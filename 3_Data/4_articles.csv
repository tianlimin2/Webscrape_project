Want to learn the language of Spain's flamenco? Come to Granada in Andalucia,"National Geographic content straight to your inbox—sign up for our popular newsletters here In this Andalucian city, flamenco is an art form as well as a way of life — not just for traditional dancers and singers but also for hip-hop stars, classical guitar legends and street artists It’s almost sunset, and the hilltop cave quarter of Sacromonte is just beginning to stir. The summer heat, which has been smothering Granada all day like a weighted blanket, has begun to lift; the heady scent of wisteria hangs on the breeze, and the shaded plazas echo with the meowing of cats and the shouts of playing children. As I walk up the steep cobbled streets, another sound filters in — the plucking of a classical guitar, coming from the open door of a hillside home. “Sacromonte has a magic of its own,” says guitarist Pepe Romero when I meet him inside. “It was here in the mountains that the Romani people settled. Then the Muslims and Jews, exiled by the Christian authorities, took refuge here in the 16th century. Sacromonte was one of the hotspots where flamenco was born, against this backdrop of oppression. Flamenco began as a lament.” Today, Pepe — a spry, charismatic 80-year-old — is one of the world’s most famous classical guitarists. Although he’s from Málaga, his musical journey owes its origins to Granada, after he was captivated by hearing his father playing Francisco Tárrega’s famous guitar piece, Recuerdos de la Alhambra. As we speak, the Alhambra itself — Granada’s famed Moorish-Christian palace, an architectural masterpiece — sits framed beyond Pepe’s balcony, against a shifting canvas of burnt ochre, rose gold and ferrous red in the quickening sunset. Despite his classical prestige, Pepe’s earliest albums in the late 1950s and early 1960s were flamenco records. “I’ve always been in love with flamenco,” he says. “Its spirit is what we call duende: something like divine inspiration, but not religious — the divinity of all humanity. When you’re in touch with that, you lose fear. Duende takes fear away.” At Pepe’s urging, I climb further up the hill to see duende in action at Cueva de la Rocío, a flamenco venue in a complex of rock-cut caves. I’m ushered into a tunnel-like room with a barrel ceiling that’s dimly lit by purple light, its rough walls hung with brass cooking pots and family photos. A drummer, singer and guitarist occupy the stage at the end, delivering impassioned songs interspersed with shouts of “Ay!” — the exclamation known as the quejío, the cry of lament. Through it all, a female dancer in a polka-dot dress improvises a captivating dance, her fingers either clicking rhythmically or clenched in defiant fists, her heels sending up a firecracker chorus of percussive taps from the polished floor. The spirit of flamenco infuses the artistic life and collective imagination of all of Granada. The labyrinthine alleyways of the Albaicín, the city’s medieval Moorish quarter, house darkly atmospheric clubs like Eshavira, where instrumentalists and singers improvise new fusions of flamenco and jazz in real time, while flamenco-inflected rock bands like Los Planetas have helped bestow on Granada the crown of indie capital of Spain. Flamenco’s hold on Granada transcends even the world of music, though, and can be found in some of the most unexpected places. The new flamenco In Realejo, a gritty, centuries-old district south of Sacromonte that was once home to Granada’s Jewish community, a striking mural shows a dark-haired woman with hooped earrings. Her forehead is marked with a bindi — a reference to the origins of the Romani in northern India. La fuerza esta en las raices, reads calligraphic writing next to her. The strength is in the roots. The mural, like the many others that brighten the elegantly fading buildings in Realejo, is the work of Raúl Ruiz, aka El Niño de las Pinturas (‘The Boy of the Paintings’) — Granada’s most celebrated street artist. I meet Raúl around the corner from the mural in his studio, where every surface is covered in flecks of paint — from the boombox pumping out house tunes, to his hand, which he extends to me in a warm greeting. “Flamenco and street art share a lot spiritually,” he says between puffs on a roll-up cigarette. “Even though graffiti came from street culture in the US, there’s a lot in common between hip-hop and flamenco. Both have singing, and are very rhythmic — hip-hop has beats, while flamenco…” He taps his feet, snaps his fingers, and emulates percussive flamenco guitar by rapping his hands against his knees. “But the main thing is a shared spirit. Both are an artistic fight. Breakdancing in the Bronx and the Romanis dancing in Sacromonte — it’s not so different.” Raúl leafs through a photobook of his work, which includes a leonine portrait of legendary gitano singer Camarón de la Isla, and a serene image of virtuoso guitarist Paco de Lucía, whose fusions of flamenco, classical and jazz made him a leading figure in the so-called nuevo flamenco (new flamenco) movement. Most of the images Raúl shows me, he says, no longer exist — removed by the authorities, despite often being commissioned by the owners of the buildings. I decide to go out and see some more of Raúl’s current crop of murals while I’ve still got the chance. I walk around the Realejo, ticking off Raúl’s pieces as I see them: vibrant paintings of guitarists, violinists, crowds clapping along to flamenco, and children playing in the street. I soon stumble across Mítica, a tattoo studio that also serves as Raúl’s official shop, selling stickers, badges and prints bearing his designs. Lured by the promise of air conditioning, I step inside and meet tattooist and street artist Paco Hidalgo, a tall man with dreadlocks and a thick beard, who tells me the government are clamping down on graffiti. “The last six months, they’ve had a zero-tolerance policy,” he says. “But the art is a gift we give to the city — the people love it.” I can believe him — the streets of the Realejo are brightened up no end by Raúl’s murals. And a punky, anti-establishment attitude is part of the neighbourhood’s modern character. That much is clear not just from the street art, but from the name of a small square down the road from the tattoo studio: Placeta Joe Strummer, named for the legendary frontman of The Clash, who found in Granada a spiritual home. One face that I see repeatedly among the painted streets of the Realejo, stencilled onto walls and lampposts, is that of Federico García Lorca, often described as both Granada’s most famous son and Spain’s most popular poet. A famous left-wing figure, he was assassinated by fascist forces in 1936, at the age of 38, and ever since he has been a symbol of Andalucian resistance against oppressive nationalism. He was a particular champion of Granada’s Romani communities — reflected in his most famous work, Gypsy Ballads — and in 1922, helped stage a flamenco festival in the grounds of the Alhambra, which has been credited with popularising the art form. More than anything, Lorca espoused the creative power and meaning of duende, describing it as “a mysterious power that everyone feels, and no philosopher can explain.” Lorca’s spirit is upheld by many of Granada’s young rap stars, who have made the city an epicentre for a new genre of music that fuses hip-hop and flamenco. Breakout stars include La Zowi and Dellafuente. I meet two others, the duo Pepe y Vizio (aka Pepe Sánchez-Vera Serrano and Vicente Perez Carmona), in the Jardines del Triunfo, a leafy park in central Granada. They’re young, with buzz cuts and beards, in baggy white T-shirts, gold chains and colourful shorts. “Lorca influences all of us artists in Granada,” says Pepe, “partly because the flamenco singers, like Enrique Morente, sang his words.” It’s refreshing to hear contemporary urban artists unselfconsciously citing the influence of their country’s long-dead and beloved poet — it’s more difficult to imagine British rappers or graffiti artists extolling the virtues of, say, William Wordsworth. But Lorca, as the embodiment of the flamenco spirit, is different — a voice for the voiceless, just like the rappers who Vicente would listen to growing up. When he met Pepe, a flamenco guitarist, they saw the ways in which their two styles could fuse. “The sounds complement each other, but so do their origins,” Vicente says. “Working classes, poverty, struggle — flamenco and hip-hop are from different countries, but their sentiments are the same.” They’re not the only ones in Granada merging the two genres, and Vicente says that the profusion of flamenco through all aspects of city life is partly responsible. ”The influence of flamenco is everywhere in Granada,” he says. “Music, painting, poetry, cinema — everywhere.” Then there’s the local accent. Andalucian Spanish is particularly suited to rap: it’s pleasingly sibilant, and the tendency to chop the ends off words creates a consonant-rich cadence that clicks like castanets. More than anything, for these rap stars — just as for the gitanos of Sacromonte in centuries past — flamenco is a wellspring for the downtrodden, of love, passion and revenge. And duende, of course, which Pepe says is a state of being for Granadinos. “You can feel the duende anytime — it doesn’t matter if you’re practising karate or making a coffee,” he says. “Flamenco is a frame of mind.” Related Topics You May Also Like In the Cook Islands, craft traditions keep national identity alive How to experience traditional South Korean culture Save $5 on a Nat Geo Digital Subscription You May Also Like 6 heritage towns in Japan to rival Kyoto How this Japanese city is keeping the geisha tradition alive How to celebrate Christmas, Polish style Is this the most spiritual destination in the Himalayas?

Top 10 things to know about Chinese New Year,"National Geographic content straight to your inbox—sign up for our popular newsletters here Lanterns glow at Thean Hou Temple in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, during Chinese New Year. We've all heard about the Year of the Snake—but what does this celebration really represent? Chinese New Year is a festival beyond compare. Technically it’s a week—determined by the lunar calendar but always late January to mid-February—but for many, Chunjie (Spring Festival) is more like 40 days of celebrations. The travel involved has been called the largest annual human migration in the entire world. China holds 1.4 billion people (18.4 percent of the world’s total population, but who’s counting?) and every year, nearly three billion people fan across the country, returning to their hometowns. Here are 10 essential things to know about this massive, annual event. Name that holiday The holiday is not celebrated just in mainland China and Hong Kong. For Chinese people, Lunar New Year is the Spring Festival, and it’s celebrated widely in Taiwan and across Southeast Asia in countries with large Chinese populations, like Singapore and Malaysia. In Korea, the Lunar New Year is called Seollal; in Vietnam, Tet; and in Tibet, Losar. (Related: See Hong Kong like a Nat Geo Explorer.) A reveler burns joss sticks for incense at Thean Hou Temple in Kuala Lumpur on the eve of the Lunar New Year. Say “Happy New Year!” In Mandarin, they’ll say gong xi fa cai (恭喜发财), wishing you a prosperous New Year. In Cantonese, it’s gong hey fat choi. Still, if you wish someone xin nian kuai le (新年快乐), literally ""Happy New Year,"" that’s perfectly welcome, too. Hear firecrackers popping Leading up to and during the Spring Festival, the streets of Chinese cities used to sound like war zones, with firecrackers exploding all night. Following a big clampdown on people setting off their fireworks in urban areas, you’ll most likely only hear these sounds in smaller towns and the countryside. The firecrackers serve two purposes: One, they’re fun and celebratory; two, they were traditionally set off to scare away dragon-lion monster Nian—who, as legend has it, would attack villagers and sometimes eat children but could be frightened off by loud noises. (Related: Learn about other top New Year's celebrations around the world.) Read the Chinese Zodiac signs This year is the Year of the Snake. There are twelve Chinese Zodiac signs, and these are taken far more seriously than a back-of-tabloid horoscope. Some signs, like the dragon, are coveted because dragons are considered to be authoritative, strong, and successful. Couples will aim to have babies in dragon years. Certain signs are said to match well with others: Dog (sincere, loyal, independent) and Rabbit (sensitive, modest, warm) are believed to be a good pairing. Your sign is determined by birth year—using the lunar calendar—so if you were born between February 17, 1988, and February 5, 1989, you’re a dragon. You would think your Zodiac year (benming nian, 本命年) would be lucky, but it’s the opposite. You’ll need to watch out for and ward off bad luck. Festive pig-themed decorations cover Yuyuan Garden ahead of the Lunar New Year in Shanghai, China. The Lunar New Year begins on February 5, 2019, marking the beginning of the Year of the Pig. See red everywhere In traditional and contemporary Chinese culture, red represents prosperity and happiness. It’s considered a lucky color, and people will wear it in celebration to usher in an auspicious new year and to keep away bad vibes. Jumpsuits, sweaters, trousers, scarves, socks, hats, anything is game. If it’s your Zodiac year you should wear more red than others, to buffer yourself from misfortune. In addition to being scared of loud noise, monster Nian is fearful of red. So, maybe red’s not your favorite color, or perhaps you want to be protected closely every single day. That’s where red underwear becomes useful. Go into any department store from December through February, or stop at one of the many street stalls selling socks and underwear, and you’ll see pair after pair of red. Decorate for good fortune Walk around older neighborhoods in any Chinese city (or the countryside) and see peoples’ windows, walls, and doors adorned. Squares of red paper with white characters like 福 (fú, good fortune) are pasted up diagonally. Red paper cuttings get taped onto windows so that passersby can admire them, and red banners (two vertical, with an optional third hanging horizontally) showcase Spring Festival couplets in gold. Likewise, in older neighborhoods, it’s not uncommon to see huge salt-cured fish hanging from power lines, drying next to the laundry. Symbolizing prosperity, fish is a must for Chinese New Year. Fish (鱼, yu) is a homonym of 余 (yu), meaning surplus or extra. In public buildings like offices, hotels, and malls, visitors will notice tasseled, red-paper lanterns strung up, and kumquat trees positioned for good luck and wealth. In Mandarin, a kumquat is called jinju (金橘), and jin (金) is the word for gold. Children help to change lanterns for the upcoming year in an old building of Yangjia village in Lin'an, China. Exchange envelopes Hongbao (红包), literally ""red packet,"" is a key element of Chinese New Year. The cash inside is considered lucky money for the upcoming year. Hongbao is generally given by elders to the younger generations, especially children, but if you earn well, it’s polite to share with your parents and grandparents this time of year. If you’re married, you must give hongbao; if you’re single, you usually receive it. If invited to someone’s house for Chinese New Year and you know they have kids, it’s nice to put some cash into a hongbao. If you’re traveling in the north, go for a round number; in the south, use lucky numbers (anything with six or eight). Don’t give a multiple of four; the number is a homonym for death. Cut hair early It’s nice to go into a new year without split ends, but for many people celebrating Spring Festival, it’s more than that. Before midnight on New Year’s Day, hair salons are abuzz with revelers, wishing to cut away last year’s bad luck and walk out with a clean, shiny slate. Then it’s no washing for 24 hours, to avoid scrubbing away the good luck. Lion dancers perform during the opening ceremony of the Ditan Park temple fair on the eve of the Lunar New Year in Beijing. Rent a date China’s generation of only children is now in their late 30s or early 40s. Many are being nagged by two parents and four grandparents to settle down and have kids. Taobao—tech titan Alibaba’s Amazon competitor, considered the world's biggest e-commerce website—offers a solution: You can rent a boyfriend or girlfriend. Prices vary, but expect to pay around $10 per hour, and more per day if your faux-beau has to travel a long distance to your hometown. (Related: Read about the young and lonely hearts of China’s shrinking cities.) Join the fun Spring Festival is mostly celebrated at home, with family. Restaurants are closed, but leading up to the New Year, tuck into heaping plates of dumplings (饺子, jiao zi)—which sounds like 交子 (jiāo zi); the second symbol, 交 (jiao) means ""exchange”, 子(zi) is an abbreviation for 11 p.m to 1 a.m. So put together, you’re exchanging the old year for the new with pillowy pockets of dough. With the ban on fireworks in cities, you won’t be shooting off pop rockets (your ears will thank you). Short of inviting yourself to someone’s house for dinner, the best bet for participating is at fairs inside temples in Beijing. The largest takes place at Ditan Park, where a canopy of red lanterns is strung overhead and performances are held daily: Tibetan folk dancing, a reenactment of the imperial family’s traditional harvest prayers, and magic shows entertain all ages. Handicrafts are for sale, including snacks like niangao (the holiday glutinous rice square) and jiaoquan (a savory cruller best dipped in doujiang, or fresh soy milk).

See southern Africa in a new light—on a lake cruise,"National Geographic content straight to your inbox—sign up for our popular newsletters here Crossing the borders of Namibia, Botswana, Zambia and Zimbabwe, land and water safaris follow the flow of the Zambezi to Lake Kariba, where a cruise offers unparalleled wildlife encounters. Two small, beady eyes are watching me. I’m close enough to see light swirling around the green irises, the black pupils reduced to the thinnest of slivers. It’s a lazy, passive, even dismissive look that’s cast my way by a ruthless killer whose craft has been honed for millennia. I can’t help but feel like prey that’s just been evaluated and deemed unworthy, but I don’t believe it for a second. Instead, I watch back. I take my time carefully examining each one of the pearly whites sticking out of the jaw. They’re used to tearing through skin, ripping apart flesh and breaking bone, just like the sharp claws resting next to them. This opportunist can wait days, even weeks for the perfect kill. Unmoved, unbothered, just poised in death-like stillness ready to strike. I’m totally unprepared for when the head suddenly snaps in my direction and I jolt back from the edge of the boat. I’m meant to be watching it back, but instead I’ve been lulled into submission by a 13-foot Nile crocodile and now I have a front seat as it slithers into the fast waters of the Zambezi. The encounter is a sign of what’s to come during my nine-day adventure, tracing the dips and curves of the Zambezi and traversing the world’s largest man-made body of water by volume, Lake Kariba, on CroisiEurope’s southern Africa safari cruise. And I soon find out, it’s not just the crocodiles watching. Several pairs of eyes look at our quietly drifting boat suspiciously. A twitch of an ear, a puff through the nostrils. Heads dip below the water as if someone’s playing invisible whack-a-mole. The hippos are curious but shy and quite cautious; they also don’t have to come back up for air for another five minutes or so. “Keep looking,” my guide Tracy Otchoumou urges. “You’ll see some more.” It’s September, at the very tail end of the dry season in southern Africa. And because of recent subpar rainy seasons, the contrast between the lush green banks of the river and the barren landscape mere steps away is stark. It also compels the animals to congregate where water is still plentiful. This means that the next day — combining land and water safaris in Chobe National Park on the banks of the Chobe River, a tributary of the Zambezi in northern Botswana — brings a breathtaking array of animal sightings. “Let the animals choose you. Whatever you’re meant to see, you’ll see,” Tracy had said earlier that morning. I’ve decided to obey — after all, it’s my first safari and a little luck wouldn’t hurt — so I leave all my expectations at the Sedudu Gate, through which we arrive as Tracy reminds us: “You must open your chakras and let the animals come to you.” And, boy, do they come. I watch giraffes graze on acacia trees, young baboons play-fight and a crafty jackal follow impalas. In this moment, I’m also reminded of the realities of African wildlife when I spot lions snoozing after feasting on a baby elephant and vultures picking out what appear to be pieces of brain through a dead water buffalo’s eye socket. But it’s once we set out on water, exploring the riverbanks, that I get to see a different side of Africa. Yes, dry season paints the landscape with a desolate brush, but it’s also alive and thriving when you’re on or by water. I’m instantly mesmerised by a herd of elephants bathing, drinking and frolicking around in the mud. An older female gently guides a youngster, about three years old, through the art of mud baths at elephant spa. “Their skin is extremely sensitive, so after bathing they have to kick up dirt or use mud to protect themselves from insect bites,” Tracy explains. I watch as these giants take care getting the dirt and mud into every skin fold and crevice. Observing their daily rituals feels more special than just watching them graze or lazily stomp across the land. The boat sails on and we continue to cross paths with crocodiles, elephants again, water buffalos and more bird species than I can count. It’s just the hippos that continue to evade me throughout my time in Botswana. Rolling dung Life on board the African Dream likes to flow in the slow lane. This eight-cabin luxury ship will be my home for half of the trip, sailing Lake Kariba on the Zimbabwe-Zambia border. Unhurried days are spent heading out on land and water safaris, docking at a new location each night. Following lectures on history and local life, conversations flow long into the night, when we’re treated to French-inspired three-course meals — a nod to the company’s roots — and an endless star-speckled sky. The lake, akin to an inland sea covering around 2,000 square miles, was only created in 1959, after the completion of the Kariba Dam on the Zambezi River. It feels like stumbling upon the remains of a prehistoric landscape, with branches of petrified trees, once part of a forest that covered the valley floor, sticking out of the water; mountains at the eastern end tower over the lake. Apart from the odd fisherman, we barely encounter other humans during our time here. “It’s the variety that always surprises me,” says my guide in Zimbabwe, Thelma Chademana, who has worked in Lake Kariba for over a decade. “The water levels change, and I see a new tree stump or a new crossing for animals appear.” “You think you know the lake but there’s always something new,” she continues. “Regardless, it feels like a safe haven.” But it hasn’t always been like that. More than 30,000 Tonga people were displaced by the building of the dam. This ethnic group from Zambia and Zimbabwe traditionally lived on the banks of the Zambezi, mainly making a living from fishing, and they found it difficult to settle elsewhere. Displeasure with the dam was also said to be expressed by Nyami Nyami, the serpent-like local river god, who was separated from his wife by the dam. According to local legends, he’s responsible for the unprecedented floods that followed the construction.But many, including my guide, believe the dam has benefited the animals. “We think it’s changed the migratory patterns of animals,” Thelma says. “They know there’s a consistent source of water here even in the dry season.” The flooding of the valley triggered one of the largest-ever animal rescue projects: Operation Noah saw over 6,000 animals relocated to safety over five years. Today, the fruits of this labour are on display in Matusadona National Park on the lake’s southeastern shore. And, although water levels are currently around 50 feet below where they should be for this time of year, there’s still enough to sustain large populations of animals, including the famous Big Five. Here, there’s life everywhere you look. I’ve seen kudus graze in the distance while I eat breakfast, spotted crocodiles bask in the midday sun and watched elephants come down to the water for an evening aperitif while fish eagles screeched above. “What does Matusadona mean?” I ask Thelma. “Oh, good question! It’s named after the abundance of the animals on the mountain slopes, if you know what I mean,” Thelma says with a smirk. “Matusa means dung and dona means rolling,” she continues. “Rolling dung.” Lessons of the land It’s the next day and I’ve been tossed around in a 4WD for an hour or so now. My back hurts, my arms are sore from having to hold on to my seat and my bottom is totally numb as we bounce, skid and slide through the backroads of Matusadona National Park. Although we’ve spotted some zebras grazing in the distance and witnessed warthogs trotting through tall grass, morale is low, the African sun relentless and the lack of any significant animal sightings has soured the mood. I find myself dreaming of my plush king-size bed on board the African Dream, when suddenly our guide and driver for the day, Mathew Gotora, brings the car to an abrupt stop. He gets out of the vehicle — something we’ve all been repeatedly told not to do under any circumstances — and slowly walks towards a clearing in complete silence. He follows some animal tracks before looking up to the sky, inspecting the position of the sun and what appears to be the direction of the wind. “He looks like he knows what he’s doing,” I whisper as he quietly sets off towards a row of trees some 30 yards away. Mathew’s gait is stiff due to sciatica he got after sliding into an aardvark hole to hide from a chasing herd of buffalo. “Or pretends that he does,” one of my travel companions quips. Mathew, who’s been a guide here for “too long” and knows every inch of the land, returns with a handful of leaves and some seeds in his palms that get distributed among us. “Break the shell,” he says. “Then get the seed out and smell it.” The group follows his instructions. “The mopane tree is a very smart tree,” Mathew continues while we all sniff at the seeds, inhaling a curious mix of cedar and aniseed. “It can close its leaves to conserve water during dry spells and each tree can communicate with others through the roots.” We all stare in disbelief as Mathew explains that the mopane can let other trees know if they’re being grazed on too much, so they can turn their leaves sour. In the coming hours we learn that white-browed sparrow-weaver nests always point westward, see how termites build mud tubes around the bark to protect themselves from heat and predators, and inspect civet dung — the latter notoriously used to make expensive coffee from partially digested beans. Later, when I set out for the last sunset tender ride, it finally clicks how seemingly disconnected and singular lessons about the lake and its flora and fauna have slowly knitted together a picture of this unique habitat, its creatures and their symbiotic relationships. The setting sun paints the sky in strokes of blush pink to the east while vivid oranges and blazing reds set the surface of the lake on fire to the west. And that’s when I see them: a bloat of hippos stirring from their daily slumber. I watch a couple of them spread their jaws wide in a satisfying yawn. Upon the boat drifting closer, the ritual now all too familiar to me begins — nostrils flare, ears twitch and heads disappear beneath the surface one by one. There’s just a single hippo left, its bloated form glistening in the evening sun. My eyes trace the scabs and cuts on its side, most likely from crocodile attacks and fighting with other hippos. I drink in every detail while I can — it’s the first one I’ve seen for more than a few seconds — and I expect it to vanish at any moment, just like the others. But it doesn’t. Instead, it watches me back.

A wine-lover's guide to the Costa Brava,"With centuries of winemaking history and a wealth of tasting experiences on offer, the Costa Brava is ideally set up for those seeking vines, views and viniculture. Most people think of the Costa Brava for its Mediterranean beaches and classic holiday resorts — and rightly so, as the coastline is spectacular — but this northeastern region of Catalonia offers more than just sea and sand. Visitors can expect a much-storied history, diverse terrain and landscapes, inspiring architecture and an exceptional food and wine scene. The region’s wine production is centred around the protected 'designation of origin’ (DO) Empordà area, which stretches from near the Pyrenees mountains in the north to the glistening Mediterranean Sea in the south, traversing the Costa Brava. The area's DO status means that wine produced in this region is regulated for quality and authenticity, making a viticultural journey one of the best ways to experience the area. Start at the beginning in Empúries While the DO Empordà wine region may only have gained its protected status in 2006, wine production here likely dates back to the ancient Greek and Roman times, both of whom settled in the area they called Empòrion and Emporiae respectively. These days, the settlement and historical ruins of the city are called Empúries and are the destination from which the wider region and the wine designation take their names. Any wine-focused exploration of the region should begin at this ancient site, to understand the scale and importance of this part of the Iberian Peninsula. The Archaeology Museum of Catalonia Empuries is the best place to start, showcasing objects that have been unearthed over the years. Only about half of the ruins have been excavated so far, so discoveries are continually being added. Combine waves and wine in Llançà Head 25 miles up the coast from Empúries and you’ll reach the fishing port of Llançà. It’s here — thanks to the team at SK Kayak — that you can experience the region’s vineyards from a different perspective. You’ll set off from the beach in your kayak and follow the coast to a small cove at Cap Ras, stopping en route to drink in the views of the green coastal vineyards near the Garbet Sea. Along the way, disembark to enjoy tastings at local wineries such as Hugas de Batlle. Enjoy views and vines at Sant Pere de Rodes Those who prefer something a little less demanding should head to the majestic Monastery of Sant Pere de Rodes. This former Benedictine monastery sits at the top of the Verdera mountain range and offers some of the best views over the Cap de Creus peninsula. This complex of Romanesque-style religious buildings is among the most important medieval sites in Catalonia, and while the buildings are vast, it’s said that no more than 20 or so monks lived here at any one time. Those who did, however, made wine. Take a tour of the impressive wine cellar with its vaulted ceiling and learn about the vineyard terraces and Ramon Pere de Noves — a monk with a particular proclivity for winemaking. Learn about tradition and conservation at Espelt Viticultors While plenty of grape varieties have been grown in Costa Brava over the centuries, there are some local varietals that are characteristic of this land, soil and location — the most common being Garnatxa and Moscatell. One of the wineries looking to preserve and grow these historic varieties is Espelt Viticultors. The family-run estate grows grapes both by the sea and inland, and since 2020, all the wines have been organic thanks to their commitment to regenerating the area’s soil and landscape. They’ve rebuilt terraces, constructed nearly 3,000 metres of dry-stone wall and entered into a land stewardship project with the IAEDEN conservation association to encourage biodiversity in the vineyards. Book one of the two-and-a-half-hour tasting tours to learn more about the vine and wine processes whilst sipping on the latest vintages. Find festivals and wellness in Peralada In the centre of Empordà stands the Castillo Peralada, a medieval castle that was once at the heart of winemaking. In 1923, the castle — or what was left of it — was bought by Miguel Mateu Pla, whose dream was to restore both the castle and the winemaking tradition of the area. Eventually, he achieved his aim, and three generations later, the family-run winery of Peralada produces more than two million bottles per year. Part of the estate is a resort with a wine-inspired spa that uses grape skins, seeds and oils as part of its treatments — try the Vitis Vinifera Ritual for all-out bliss. In the summer months, Peralada is also home to the Castell de Peralada Music Festival, which has taken place annually for nearly 40 years. Wine and dine in Girona No trip to the Costa Brava would be complete without one final stop in the colourful city of Girona. Sat at the meeting point of four rivers, the city has been home to settlements since at least the Roman times, a history that endures in the remains of the old city walls. Girona's centre is an architectural and cultural blend that features Islamic, Jewish, and Roman influences, best explored by getting lost in the winding streets. Cool off by dipping into one of the city’s chic wine bars, many of which specialise in natural wines. For the ultimate experience, try to snag a table on the terrace at the trendy La Tabarra. Its wine list has a great selection of red, white and rosé wines from DO Empordà — all perfect to pair with its small plates such as batter-fried prawn brioche or Asian-style steak tartare.

Bike your way through New Zealand's best wineries,"National Geographic content straight to your inbox—sign up for our popular newsletters here Take advantage of the country’s expansive bike trail network while also visiting some of the top wine regions on the planet. Known for its stunning scenery and world-famous wine scene, it only makes sense to combine the two while visiting New Zealand. With the New Zealand Cycle Trail system spanning more than 1,739 miles (2,800 kilometers) throughout the North Island and South Island — with more trails on the way — it’s never been easier to get around the country on two wheels. Cycling from vineyard to vineyard rather than joining a driving tour allows you to soak up the region’s natural beauty and be more flexible with your itinerary. And, you get to experience these world-class wine regions in a more sustainable and eco-friendly way. Central Otago The Central Otago wine region, specifically the stunning Gibbston Valley, is also known as the pinot noir capital of New Zealand. Located just a stone's throw away from the famous mountain town and sustainability hot spot of Queenstown, the valley is easily accessible and perfect for a day trip. This wine region is home to Valli, the winner of Best in Show at the Decanter World Wine Awards 2022; Alan Brady of Wild Irishman, who is known as the father of pinot noir in New Zealand; and the all-female, sustainably-minded team at Coal Pit — it’s a must-visit for lovers of red wine. The Gibbston River Trail runs 5.4 miles (8.7 kilometers) along the Valley of Vines from the iconic Kawarau Suspension Bridge, known for its bungee experiences. Rent a bike or e-bike from Around the Basin in Queenstown; they will drop you and your bike off at one end, pick you up at the other, and return you to town. To make the most out of your cycle through the vines, check out the cellar door — also known as a tasting room — at Kinross. This small vineyard makes its own wine, but its tasting room is also home to Valli, Wild Irishman, Coal Pit, and Hawkshead, and it’s the only cellar door offering tastings from these winemakers. A quick pedal next door brings you to Mt. Rosa, a family-owned vineyard with lawn games. Marlborough If there is one region that is synonymous with New Zealand wine, then it’s Marlborough. Known as the home of sauvignon blanc, this popular wine region at the top of the South Island draws thousands of visitors to its 168 wineries each year. To explore this amazing wine region on two wheels, check out the aptly named Wine Tours by Bike. Family-owned and -operated since 1999, they have a few options for tours with or without shuttles to help you get the most out of your day. Based out of Renwick, with pickups available from nearby Blenheim, Wine Tours by Bike boasts 14 wineries within a 3-mile radius (5 kilometers) of its rental shop, including Hans Herzog Estate and Nautilus Estate. From there, you can reach the legendary Cloudy Bay in around 30 minutes by bike. It’s one of the best places to enjoy a self-guided wine and bike tour. Waiheke Island If you want to explore beautiful vineyards, artistic communities, and amazing beaches without leaving the Auckland region, jump on the ferry to Waiheke Island. The ferry takes just 35 minutes from downtown Auckland, and you can rent e-bikes from eRide Waiheke. Conveniently, eRide Waiheke is based inside the Matiatia Ferry Terminal, so you can easily pre-book a tour, or rent a bike when you arrive. Despite the island only being about 32 square miles (82.9 square kilometers), there are still around 30 vineyards and wineries on the island, including the popular Man O’ War vineyards, Mudbrick, Passage Rock, and Cable Bay Vineyards, which houses a restaurant with panoramic views. If you plan on visiting Man O’ War at the far eastern end of the island, give yourself plenty of time to bike. The round-trip journey is around 34 miles (55 kilometers) on the rural roads and gravel tracks. For a more relaxing ride, opt for the 5 Bays Ride that brings you through “Wineries Valley” and along some of Waiheke’s most spectacular beaches. Give yourself around six hours to experience the tastings, lunch, take a dip in the refreshing waters, and pedal there and back. Hawke's Bay As the oldest wine-growing region in New Zealand, Hawke’s Bay is a must-visit destination, with more than 90 vineyards in the area. One of the best things about this region is the variety of grapes. You can easily find vineyards growing chardonnay, merlot, pinot gris, syrah, cabernet sauvignon, malbec, sauvignon blanc, and viognier. Travel along the dedicated wineries section of the Hawke's Bay cycle trail on a self-guided bike tour with local operator, On Yer Bike Winery Tours. Choose from two different routes, visiting between three-and-six wineries in one day; you’ll travel through the famous Gimblett Gravels region and the Bridge Pa Triangle wine-growing subsections of Hawke’s Bay. If you want to go farther afield with your own bike, the Hawke’s Bay trails cover 124 miles (200 kilometers) all over the region. If you’re interested in a longer adventure, the Classic New Zealand Wine Trail is a five-day cycling tour through Hawke’s Bay and neighboring Marlborough. Gisborne The Gisborne wine region is the third-largest wine-producing region in New Zealand. Located on the East Coast of the North Island, this predominantly white wine-producing region is also known for its amazing seafood and surf scene. Jump on the dedicated vineyard bike tour with Cycle Gisborne, visit three vineyards, and enjoy a delicious platter of local food along the way. If you love both the grapes and the grain, there’s also the Great Taste Tour, where you can sample local wine, beers, and ciders, with around 6.2 miles (10 kilometers) of cycling in between. Some of the best vineyards to check out include Bushmere Estate, with its wonderful restaurant, and Wrights Vineyard and Winery, which has some of the oldest vines in the region. This is a more compact wine region, compared with some on this list, but it is worth the visit, especially when that East Coast sunshine hits in the summer months.

Everything you need to know about sports tourism,"National Geographic content straight to your inbox—sign up for our popular newsletters here Travelling to watch sporting events has grown into a multi-billion-pound industry. And destinations are answering the call, leveraging sports tourism to boost economies and offer visitors both excitement and cultural immersion. Twenty-one years ago, armed with a backpack and England rugby shirt, I set off for Australia. After 18 joyless months of saving up my salary and holiday days, three glorious, sunlit weeks Down Under awaited. But it wasn’t just Australia’s manifold charms that had drawn me in. England were among the favourites to win the Rugby World Cup, which was being held there that October, and I’d bought a tickets-and-accommodation package to cheer them on. Would I have sacrificed so much to go to Australia if it hadn’t been for the tournament? Doubtful. Would I have followed England on tour anywhere other than this most alluring of destinations? Definitely not. It’s this seductive symbiosis that forms the foundation of what — in the intervening years — has grown to become one of the most profitable and influential sectors of the global travel industry. Today, sports tourism is worth more than £500 billion and accounts for 10% of the total tourism market, according to Madrid-based United Nations agency UN Tourism. And that’s set to accelerate over the coming decade, with some projections suggesting a quadrupling of the sector by 2033 to £2.25 trillion. There are numerous economic and societal factors that feed into this, from bigger, and better promoted, events to increasingly active, health-conscious populations supporting and participating in sports. But the primary driving force is something the sporting world understands only too well: success breeds success. The demonstrable boost to income, global profile and downstream visitor numbers that has resulted from hosting high-profile events is bringing more and more destinations to the table — including those with barely any sporting pedigree to speak of. “The industry is constantly expanding. It feels like we’re riding the crest of a wave at the moment,” says Jimmy Rowan, head of UK sports travel specialist Spectate. Catering to what it calls the ‘I was there’ moments, the Chester-based operation encompasses a dozen sports, scores of destinations and trips ranging in duration from a weekend away at a Formula One race to cricket tours such as the Ashes that last nearly two months. “What we’re seeing is that people are either building travel ideas around iconic sporting events or going to such events and tagging on a holiday as part of that.” The growing trend of using travel to celebrate landmark birthdays and other milestones is further fuelling the sector, he says. “A lot of the time we get people who are looking to mark an anniversary or a 50th or 60th birthday by heading off for a once-in-a-lifetime sporting experience.” Like many of the big players in sports tourism, access to the stars — usually in the form of a Q&A or after-dinner speech — is offered as an additional incentive. Book on Spectate’s four-night Abu Dhabi Grand Prix trip, for example, and you’ll find yourself brunching with Guenther Steiner, former Haas F1 team principal and star of the hit Netflix series Drive to Survive. Get active Spectate largely focuses on ‘passive’ sports tourism — people travelling to watch matches, races or tournaments, and combining this with more conventional touristic pursuits. But ‘active’ (i.e. participatory) trips are increasingly in demand. Manchester-based Sports Tours International has running and cycling at the core of its business. It offers VIP trips to follow cycling’s three grand tours: the Tour de France, the Vuelta a España and the Giro d’Italia. But its ride-and-watch itineraries — tackling part of a stage in the Alps ahead of the elite riders— are another popular option. The value of these lavish, telegenic cycling races to the tourist economies of the cities and regions they pass through is clear in the contest to host them. Competition to host the Tour’s Grand Départ — the nomadic opening of the three-week event, which is watched by more than 10 million spectators and a billion television viewers — is fierce, with destinations paying race organiser Amaury Sport Organisation (ASO) many millions of pounds for the privilege. Barcelona reportedly parted with more than £6.5 million to host the first stages of the 2026 Tour de France. The Catalan capital knows all about the long-term benefits of landing a prestige sporting event; its staging of the 1992 Olympics supercharged its ailing economy, bolstered its infrastructure and gave the city a global profile that it translated into a 30-year tourism boom. For Sports Tours International’s running customers, participation is also the primary focus. It sends approximately 4,000 entrants a year to the six major marathons around the world, says Ben Thompson, the company’s marketing lead. It guarantees entry to these sought-after races in cities such as New York and Tokyo, handles on-the-ground logistics and builds wider holiday itineraries around the races. “I think there’s a greater awareness today that you can combine travel with the sports of your choice,” says Thompson. “It’s a whole different way of seeing the world.” Hallowed turf Golf is another sport that lends itself to the ‘active’ (in relative terms) side of sports tourism. Your Golf Travel is the leading UK operator in this space, handling 200,000 clients a year and offering trips to 30-plus countries. These feature rounds on iconic courses, as well as spectator packages to events such as the Ryder Cup and the Masters, in Augusta, Georgia. Norbert Falkner achieved a lifelong dream when he travelled to the latter in 2019. The 50-year-old banker from Berkshire described his visit to the hallowed greens and fairways of Augusta National Golf Club, where he rubbed shoulders with Tiger Woods, as an almost ‘spiritual experience’. “I was first in and last out every day,” he says. “And then when it was all over, I got to travel around Georgia and play a few rounds of my own.” Falkner, a father of two teenage boys, hopes to take the family to Australia on an Ashes-focused break. “The next series is scheduled to begin in Perth, marking the first time in four decades that the opening will not be held in Brisbane. The boys would love it out there,” he says with a smile. The Falkners aside, the sports tourism market is becoming increasingly diverse. Women’s sport has never been more high-profile or popular, exemplified by the 87,000 fans who watched England’s Lionesses win the Euros in 2022. “We get quite a few women travelling with us on things like Caribbean cricket tours,” says Rowan from Spectate. “And where the longer tours tend to be older people or retirees with plenty of disposable income, weekends away for something like an NFL [American football] game or an F1 race are increasingly appealing to younger demographics,” he explains. Indeed, F1 embodies many of the forces shaping the wider sports tourism boom. It’s one of the fastest-growing sports in the world; a 2021 study by research company Nielsen Sports found that both the overall fanbase and proportion of female followers had almost doubled since 2017. The Netflix series Drive to Survive is credited with much of that growth and diversification, with a poll of nearly 2,000 American F1 fans in 2022 showing that 53% traced their conversion to the show. Subsequently, everything from tennis and horse racing to golf and gymnastics have commissioned similarly high-budget, under-the-bonnet docuseries. Engagement is the buzzword — and engaged fans, the sports tourism market is finding, are travelling fans. This growing group has, in turn, helped to drive an expansion of the F1 calendar, which now has 24 races a year — eight more than 20 years ago. The increase in supply keeping pace with the growing demand is evident across the sporting landscape. For example, when Los Angeles last hosted the Olympics in 1984, there were 21 sports. In four years, when the Games return to California’s largest city, that number will have grown to 35. In a similar vein, the next FIFA World Cup will be the first to be played across three nations and the first to feature 48 teams, up from 32. For travelling sports fans, there’s simply never been more choice. What happens in Vegas Las Vegas is no stranger to sports tourism; high-profile boxing matches have been as much a part of the city’s USP over the years as Elvis and Sinatra residences. But, post-pandemic, the city has placed sport at the centre of its tourism strategy, with astonishing success. Steve Hill, CEO and president of the Las Vegas Convention and Visitors Authority, says a programme that now includes the Las Vegas Grand Prix and featured American sport’s flagship event, the Super Bowl, earlier this year is worth “well into the double-digit billion dollars to Las Vegas” each year. Annual visitor numbers are almost back to their 43 million peak of 2016, but tastes are changing. “About 6% of our tourists come because of sport alone, but around double that are including it in the many reasons for visiting,” says Hill. “So, it has broadened our potential customer base and that’s important. It has also brought a global spotlight to Las Vegas that we simply couldn’t buy.” Among the various events the city will be hosting in 2025 is a quartet of rugby league games in a single day, including Wigan against Warrington from Europe’s Super League, and two matches from the NRL, Australia’s primary domestic tournament. This ‘portability’ of sporting events, as Hill calls it, is one reason to project unfettered growth. A leg of the Tour de France held in Rio or an Ashes Test match in Las Vegas currently sounds preposterous, but then so did the idea of staging the 2022 FIFA World Cup in the diminutive football desert of Qatar. The result? A record four million tourist arrivals in 2023. Using sport as an engine of tourism is something that Qatar’s neighbour, Saudi Arabia, has seized upon with even more success. The kingdom has invested nearly £4.6 billion in the sports industry since 2021 alone. It has hosted more than 80 international events, drawing 2.6 million attendees, in just five years — including world-title boxing bouts, ATP tennis and America’s Cup sailing. Professor Rob Wilson, an applied sport finance expert at the University Campus of Football Business (UCFB) in London, expects the sports tourism business to rise ‘exponentially’ in coming years. He attributes this to the ongoing affordability of flights and travel, and the marketing power of the TV broadcasting of events such as the Paris 2024 Olympics and the Qatar World Cup.“This puts those destinations into the psyche of viewers,” he says. “And we’re seeing that this is influencing how they choose their next trip.” However, there is one significant drawback to sports tourism — at least where big tournaments are concerned — as I discovered on that 2003 trip. Pessimist that I am, I only secured tickets up to the quarter-finals. This meant that, as Jonny Wilkinson was drop-kicking England to victory on that sultry evening in Sydney, I was already back at home enveloped in the dreariness of a British winter.

How Singapore is embracing edible insects,"National Geographic content straight to your inbox—sign up for our popular newsletters here Singapore has long held a reputation for its diverse and experimental food scene, and now adventurous diners can tuck into creepy crawlies in the city’s bars and hawker stalls. “It tastes like sunflower seeds,” says Hoo Ee Ming, owner of the Grains & Leaf hawker stall in the basement of Singapore’s Golden Mile Food Centre, casually tossing a cricket in his mouth as if it were popcorn. Perched on a stool, I’m staring into a plastic container filled with the dried, deceased crickets, which Ming buys already de-legged, coated in salted egg flavouring. Having grown up in a Western culture, the thought of sprinkling creepy crawlies on my salad isn’t exactly making my mouth water. But I gingerly pop a tiny cricket between my teeth. Nothing bad happens; there’s a satisfying crunch and the saltiness of the seasoning. Emboldened, I try Ming’s other salad topper: mealworms. At about two centimetres long, they also pack a hefty crunch. “These taste like roasted peanut skins,” Ming says. As I mix them through the salad, I detect that salty nuttiness and concede that they add a nice texture to this healthy lunch. Ming says the protein insects contain make them a natural addition to his salad stall, alongside his honey-roasted-chicken salads, Caesar salads and salmon poke bowls. But what are his customers saying about the optional bugs on the menu? “People are worried about the look,” he says. “They can accept the taste, but can’t look. I tell them, close your eyes and try one bite first.” Customers are adjusting to the prospect of having insects on their plate, however. They were only approved for human consumption in Singapore in July 2024, with the Singapore Food Agency (SFA) allowing the import and sale of 16 species, including crickets, mealworms, locusts and moth larvae. Insect Food, run by Javier Yip, is the first company to import edible insects to Singapore. “I love to eat edible insects,” he explains when I meet him at his office. “It's my passion. I’ve eaten them in Thailand and Vietnam. I've even had scorpions before.” There are no insect farms in Singapore yet, and Javier only recently cleared all the regulatory hurdles to establish an import supply chain. “The SFA is so strict, so it’s difficult to find the right suppliers,” he says. The insects must come from farms, as wild-harvested bugs may carry bacteria or be exposed to pesticides. Although there are thousands of farms across China and Thailand, the SFA only approves those with certain safety certifications. Once the bugs arrive in Singapore, a sample is tested before they can be sold. Through his website, Javier sells bulk packs of dried crickets and mealworms, frozen locusts and silkworm pupae, and powdered insects. Snack packs are sold in local supermarket chain Sheng Siong under Javier’s retail brand, Insect Yumz. In his boardroom, I’m bravely sampling a pack of tom-yum-flavoured crickets, which remind me instantly of punchy Thai soup with chill, lime and prawn on the palette. Next, I try cricket bites in a tomato-based sweet-and-spicy barbecue flavouring, a puffed and ruffled snack aiming to tap the niche of potato crisps. For many, a diet including insects isn’t new. According to the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO), edible insects are thought to be consumed in more than 100 countries. With their high protein levels, insects may contribute to meeting future global food demands — reporting by the FAO states that farming these ‘mini-livestock’ can benefit the environment as crickets, for example, need one-sixth of the amount of feed of cattle and half as much as pigs and chickens to produce the same amount of protein. Insects also emit less greenhouse gases and ammonia than conventional livestock. Dr Maria Antonia Guillermo-Tuazon, a senior nutrition and agrifood systems specialist with the FAO, says the farming and consumption of insects aligns with the UN’s 2030 Sustainable Development Goals. “We want to achieve triple wins, simultaneously promoting social development that’s inclusive of food security and nutrition, economic growth and environmental sustainability.” She adds that the demand for edible insects is booming in Europe, as people seek alternatives to meat. Edible insect powders, which can be added to all kinds of dishes for a protein boost, are especially popular. “When you're eating grasshoppers or crickets, sometimes their legs get stuck between your teeth,” Antonia says. The powder format, however, removes any visual or textural challenges. Another business with a mission to make insects more palatable is Fura, a small bar and eatery in a trendy shophouse on Chinatown’s Amoy Street, a popular spot for food and drink. Here, I meet co-owner Christina Rasmussen, whose aim is to inspire guests to consume more sustainably by featuring key ingredients that are either invasive, prevalent or plentiful. While many dishes are vegan, some incorporate insects, invasive jellyfish and even lab-cultured quail parfait. In the open kitchen, Christina pulls tart cases from the oven and arranges flowers atop pretty dishes as she explains her philosophy. “We recognise that not everyone can be vegan,” she says. “Insects come into play because they’re a great protein source, in abundance and require fewer resources.” For some Singaporeans, eating insects will still require a mindset shift. “Many people don't like eating insects because it's associated with poverty or desperation — and we want to change that,” she says. I kick off my night with a cocktail called Get the Worm. Inspired by a classic margarita, with the tang of tequila, zesty lime and a hint of orange, this drink also features mealworms, pan-fried with garlic and 15 different spices then glazed with tequila. The worm itself is filtered out before serving, but the savoury, spicy flavour is infused into this slightly cloudy, punchy cocktail. Next, Christina slides two plates my way. The first, peas in threes, features pea shoots, sweet peas and a peanut cricket dukkah. “It's a good way to introduce the texture,” she explains. The second dish is called pumpkin layers. A tart with amaranth crust, it’s loaded with pickled beetroot and insect garum, a fermented paste made from heat-dried locusts, grasshoppers and blackened barley koji, later blended with charred pepper, walnuts and apple cider vinegar. The tart’s garnish is a curly ribbon of squash, dotted with dainty blue-and-pink edible petals. “That one’s my favourite on the menu,” Christina says. “It's beautiful, and I think it does bugs justice.” With its sweet, nutty flavour and the impeccable presentation, this dish is pure luxury. And if this is what it takes to save the planet while giving my body a protein boost, I’ll happily order more.

A beginner’s guide to sailing Croatia’s Dalmatian Coast,"Cruise tranquil seas, enjoy scenic landscapes and stop at picturesque villages along the way — Croatia’s Dalmatian Coast is ideal for easing first-time sailors into life on the water. With an abundance of seemingly deserted coves and beaches, the Dalmatian Coast is home to a number of harbour towns studded with Venetian bell towers and dotted with plazas where flagstones have been smoothed by centuries of visitors. Discover a different bay or quay each day travelling by boat, sailing over Southern Croatia’s clear, glassy waters. Whether you’re looking to learn the ropes or have an expert skipper take the helm, here’s how to plan a Dalmatian Coast sailing experience. When’s the best time to go? The Dalmatian Coast buzzes with sailboats from April until early November, but the Adriatic Sea is at its smoothest in June, July and August. If you’re unencumbered by school holidays, then May and September can bring a delightful combination of warm, sunny weather, calm seas and — relative to mid-summer months — few other travellers. How long should I go for? Sailing is a relaxed way to travel and trip lengths can be flexible — it helps to take note of any destination highlights that pique your interest and plan around visiting these. A week allows you to settle into the rhythm of on-board life while sailing to out-of-the-way locations. In two weeks, you’ll truly begin to feel a sense of escapism and a deeper familiarity with sailing. To gain more confidence, you could also combine five days of sailing school with a week of putting your new knowledge into practice. How calm are the waters? In summer, anchorages such as Krknjasi Bay just off the east coast of Drvenik Veli island — also known as the ‘Blue Lagoon’ for the turquoise and azure shades of its waters — are often calm enough to give your boat that magical floating-on-air appearance. And at spots such as Prirovo Beach on Vis island, the still water often provides a crystal-clear view down to the seabed. There may be times when the wind whips up and your journey becomes bumpier, but that’s the best time to experience the thrill of sailing. Plus, the beauty of being on a boat is that you can sail to the nearest island’s sheltered side. That said, it’s useful to have over-the-counter motion sickness medication on hand just in case you need it. Consider, too, how different types of boats act on the water. Catamarans, for example, offer stability and a comfortable sailing experience, whereas monohull yachts heel over (lean to the side), but provide lots of hands-on sailing action. Where should I start from? Dubrovnik is a great starting point for sailing voyages. With a pretty, pedestrianised centre packed full of restaurants, bars and ancient buildings, the city also has an efficient public transport system, meaning you can reach the marina from the airport in just 30 minutes. Another convenient starting point is the appropriately named village of Marina, just a 25-minute drive from Split Airport. This small and serene village has plenty of excellent restaurants overlooking its harbour, Marina Agana, where you can sample some delicious Croatian cuisine before you set off. Can you suggest an itinerary? Visit lively harbours, remote beaches, ancient settlements and verdant pine forests as you sail to spectacular islands along the Dalmatian Coast, beginning and ending in Dubrovnik. Start with a 90-minute sail (weather dependent) from Dubrovnik to the naturally beautiful Island of Šipan. Enjoy a meal at one of the waterfront tavernas in the small village of Šipanska Luka, tucked beneath steep, forested hills between Šipan’s north and Jakljan Island. A further two-hour sail away, Pelješac Peninsula’s pristine waters provide the perfect opportunity for snorkelling. Next, journey four hours to the fishing village of Polače on the northern coast of Mljet, Croatia’s greenest island. A sheltered harbour and one of Mljet’s oldest settlements, Polače is home to well-preserved remains of a Roman palace, Rimska Palača. From there, another extended cruise will take you to the shores of remote Lastovo Island. With its network of quiet hiking trails, Lastovo feels a million nautical miles from bustling Dubrovnik. The next morning, take a jaunt across to the island of Korčula and its impressive, medieval walled city, Korčula Old Town. Then, make your way back towards Dubrovnik, with a detour at spectacular Saplunara Bay on Mljet’s eastern tip (no more than a six-hour sail from Korčula), where secluded sandy beaches are fringed by pine trees. Which islands have the best ports? You’ll find well-equipped and easily accessible ports on just about any island in the Dalmatian archipelago, but those closer to the mainland and with regular ferry connections, such as Hvar, tend to be busier. Meanwhile, ports on islands further out in the Adriatic Sea, such as Lastovo, are usually quieter. Mljet Island has a myriad of delightfully remote anchorages, while Vela Luka on Korčula Island is a typical Croatian marina that feels as though it’s in the town centre. What should I pack? In addition to your standard seaside essentials, such as a bathing suit and towel, be sure to pack sunglasses and water-resistant sunscreen. The sea breeze will usually keep bothersome bugs away from your boat, although insect repellent can be necessary in some places when going ashore. Take advantage of Croatia’s translucent waters by packing a waterproof camera to snap some underwater shots — remember to pack your snorkelling gear, too. Do I need any qualifications to sail? To skipper a boat, you need to have an International Certificate for Operators of Pleasure Craft (ICC) issued by the Royal Yachting Association (RYA), with a Day Skipper qualification or above, as well as a VHF radio licence. If you’re completely new to sailing and keen to learn the ropes, attending a sailing school is a good place to start. In Marina Agana, near Split, Sunsail's Agana Sailing School offers a variety of course options for a range of sailing abilities. Alternatively, enlist the help of a qualified skipper and sail as part of the crew — as a crew member, you don't need to have any formal qualifications. Your skipper will take the helm as you sail along your chosen route (known as ‘bareboat’ sailing) or you can follow a set sailing itinerary along with a group of other boats (flotilla sailing).

10 must-do experiences in Italy’s Campania region,"National Geographic content straight to your inbox—sign up for our popular newsletters here It’s home to the Amalfi Coast, Capri, Pompeii and Naples, Italy’s third-largest city, plus limoncello and buffalo mozzarella. Here’s how to see the best of Campania. The southern Italian region of Campania (Campagna in Italian) is famous for its dramatic coastline and picturesque seaside towns, rich culinary traditions, and ancient archaeological sites. It is one of Italy’s most densely populated regions, thanks largely to the sprawling city of Naples (Napoli), which sits in the shadow of Mount Vesuvius. And while Naples, the archaeological park of Pompeii, the Amalfi Coast, and the islands of the Bay of Naples are among the biggest draws here, Campania is much more than just its bucket list destinations. Beyond its heavy-hitter sights, Campania is all about authentic small towns, wild coastlines, and small-scale wineries and food producers. This must-do list of experiences offers advice on how to eat, sip, and sightsee your way through some of Campania’s best-known destinations, plus expert insights into less-visited locations that are equally worthy of your time. Savor Naples’ street food and soulful history The history, energy and anima, or soul of Naples, seem to ooze from its chaotic streets and ancient stone walls and echo in the sounds of shouting merchants and buzzing mopeds. The best way to experience Italy’s third largest city is to dive into the daily, pulsating rhythm of La Bella Napoli on Spaccanapoli (Via San Biagio Dei Librai), the narrow, crowded and vibrant street that divides the city’s historic center. It, along with parallel Via dei Tribunali, is also Naples’ street food central. As you explore nearby sights like the Duomo of Naples, the Naples Underground, and the San Severo Chapel, home to the astounding Veiled Christ sculpture, sample savory handheld treats like fried pizza from Gino Sorbillo, salty almond cookies from Taralleria Napoletana, or paper cones of fried seafood from Il Cuoppo. Finish it off with a sfogliatella, Naples’ signature pastry, at Sfogliate e Sfogliatelle. Consider booking a food tour to hit (and taste) all the highlights. (Related: 10 must-do experiences in Italy's Lazio region.) Visit the Amalfi Coast’s lesser-known towns The most famous towns of the Amalfi Coast are Positano, Ravello, and Amalfi—each beautiful, rife with Insta-friendly panoramas, and, from May to October, overrun with visitors. Of the three, tour operator Cherrye Moore prefers Amalfi, especially in the evening, when day-trippers have cleared out. But for her guests seeking a more local vibe, she recommends nearby Atrani, where, she says, “you’ll still see residents out having dinner at local restaurants that are not just geared to tourists. Plus, it’s not like the great views stop once you leave Amalfi!” She also likes Praiano for those looking for a quieter stay. No matter what towns you visit along the coast, Moore recommends seeing them by sea, rather than from a bus or car on the always-clogged Amalfi Coast road. “Get out on the water and visit the villages by boat, maybe stopping for lunch along the way.” Island-hop in style Of the three geographically diverse islands in the Bay of Naples, Capri is the best known, famous for its jet-set appeal and illustrious past residents and guests—from Roman emperors to Russian revolutionaries to Mariah Carey. The enchanting Blue Grotto is here, as are the Faraglioni, the massive sea stacks where the sirens may have tempted Odysseus. Equally tempting for modern visits are a bevy of luxury hotels, designer shopping, and gardens and villas turned into museums. In contrast, the larger, more low-key island of Ischia is known for its thermal spas, fed by mineral springs bubbling up in this volcanically active area. The island’s Bay of Sorgeto is surely one of the most unique beaches in the world, where hot water spills into the sea and bathers soak in a 90°F natural “hot tub.” When you visit Ischia, allow time for a stop at tiny, pastel-colored Procida, where Il Postino and The Talented Mr. Ripley were filmed. (Related: Here are 10 not-to-be-missed things to do when visiting Sicily.) Get an immersive look at Pompeii With its miles of stone streets, unrelenting Mediterranean sunshine, and often dense crowds, it’s easy to just scratch the surface of the Pompeii Archaeological Park. That’s why Moore so heartily recommends Journey to Pompeii, a virtual reality tour that can be done with or without an accompanying guide. “It is knock-your-socks-off excellent,” she says. The experience recreates life in ancient Pompeii and follows residents as they go about their daily lives in the hours leading up to the catastrophic eruption of Vesuvius. If VR (virtual reality) is not your style, Moore recommends hiring a private guide to take you through the site. “You’ll see more in a few hours with a guide than you might in an entire day on your own.” Tour Greek ruins and a buffalo mozzarella farm Pompeii and nearby Herculaneum get all the attention thanks to their dramatic demise. But further down the coast, the Archaeological Park of Paestum offers three magnificently preserved Greek temples and plenty of uncrowded space to revel in their scale and beauty. The remains date to the 5th to 6th centuries B.C.E., when Campania was part of Magna Grecia, the settlements founded by Greek immigrants. An on-site museum houses the most important finds from Paestum, including several whimsical tomb paintings. Paestum’s proximity to the Campanian heartland makes it easy to combine ancient culture with … dairy culture. The region is Italy’s top producer of mozzarella di bufala, or buffalo mozzarella, a protected product that is to mozzarella what champagne is to sparkling wine. Travel planner Madeline Jhawar prefers sending clients to Tenuta Vannulo, a historic buffalo farm that’s well-organized for foodie tourism. Buy limoncello right from the source Campania’s ubiquitous lemon-flavored digestivo, limoncello, is made across the region, but it’s most strongly associated with sunny Sorrento and the Amalfi Coast, where everything seems to have a lemony theme. A short distance from Sorrento’s historic center, several distilleries produce limoncello, and at some, you can visit the lemon groves, view the assembly line, and, naturally, sample and shop. Arrange recommended tours at the family-run Azienda Agricola Galano and the larger facility at Sorrento Excellence. Farther along the Amalfi Coast, you can hike the fragrant, scenic Path of Lemons, and stop for a tour and tasting in a lemon grove. (Related: The essential guide to visiting Italy's Sardinia region.) Explore the wild coast of Cilento The Campania coast extends for more than 300 miles, much of it well off the map of mass tourism, especially when you enter Cilento National Park, with its untamed beaches and mountainous interior marked by tiny, isolated hilltowns. Tour operator Danielle Oteri says the small villages along the Cilento coast, including Santa Maria Castellabate, Pioppi, and Acciaroli, are like what the Amalfi Coast was 50 years ago, with clear views of Capri and Amalfi but hardly any crowds outside of August. The southern edge of Cilento may be the best-kept secret in all of Europe. Most of its beaches, she says, can only be reached by boat or via steep hikes. Oteri adds that the area is a prime anchovy breeding ground. Cilento Blu in Marina di Camerota offers night fishing excursions, which conclude with a cookout of freshly caught fish on a secret beach. Eat the world’s best pizza “If Italy has the best pizza in the world, and you eat at the best pizzeria in Italy, then you’re eating the world’s best pizza,” reasons Moore when speaking of Pepe in Grani, located in the humble hilltown of Caiazzo. She’s a fan of their tasting menu and signature spritz cocktail. Caiazzo may be out of the way, but the pizza is popular enough that reservations are recommended. Consider booking well in advance to try the pizza at Caserta’s I Masanielli. According to writer Laura Itzkowitz, the chefs at both pizzerias have truly elevated pizza to gourmet food, and you should visit at least one of them when visiting Campania. (Related: These are the must-see sights of Italy’s Abruzzo region.) Go for Baroque at Reggia di Caserta Less than an hour inland from Naples, travel back in time to the late Baroque era, where the Royal Palace of Caserta (Reggia di Caserta), surpasses France’s Versailles in scale and ambition. Built by the House of Bourbon, the French-Spanish dynasty that once reigned over southern Italy and Sicily, the palace contains 1,400 rooms across five floors, with every hall and salon as ornate as the next. Outside, there are vast gardens with fountains, grottoes, statuary, side gardens, and a cascading waterfall, which is reached via a two-mile (3.3-km) canal-side promenade. The entire palace complex has been a UNESCO World Heritage site since 1997. The entrance to the palace is right in front of the Caserta train station, which is about a 40-minute train ride from Naples’ main station, Napoli Centrale. Sip wine on the slopes of Vesuvius Over the millennia, the numerous eruptions of Mount Vesuvius have left their mark on the region, and not just on the poignant remains of Pompeii and neighboring sites. Like Sicily’s Mount Etna, the volcanic terrain on the slopes of Vesuvius is mineral-rich, and highly suited for growing grapes. The signature wine of Vesuvius is Lacryma Cristi, or the “tears of Christ,” which comes in red and white varieties. Archaeologists have determined it’s very similar to the wine consumed at Pompeii in antiquity. Many Vesuvius producers offer vineyard and winery tours that culminate with tastings, usually accompanied by lunch or light snacks of local products. Getting around Travelers to Campania will most likely arrive in Naples via high-speed Trenitalia or Italo trains from Rome, or by flying into Naples International Airport. From Naples, it’s possible to reach Pompeii, Herculaneum, Sorrento, and Caserta by train, or catch ferries to the Bay of Naples Islands. Ferries from Naples or Sorrento to several towns of the Amalfi Coast run year-round, with more frequent trips in the summertime. Where to stay In Naples, Casa d’Anna is an art-filled boutique hotel in the increasingly trendy Sanità area, while on the seafront, Grand Hotel Vesuvio offers 5-star comforts. Luxury hotels abound on Capri, with Grand Hotel Quisisana undoubtedly the grandest of the dames. Nearby, La Residenza Capri is a relaxed, affordable 4-star with a nice pool area. On Ischia, resort-like Mezzatore has its own beach and thermal spa. Near Amalfi, the elegant Hotel Santa Caterina features a cliffside elevator descending to a sea-level swimming pool. Farther down the coast, Borgo La Pietraia is a breezy boutique option, while in Paestum, Savoy Hotel & Spa offers a restful beach break and proximity to the archaeological park.

"The story behind haggis, Scotland's national dish","National Geographic content straight to your inbox—sign up for our popular newsletters here Haggis is ceremoniously served to a soundtrack of bagpipes each year on Burns Night. But where did this offal-based creation come from? A quintessentially Scottish dish, haggis is a savoury, offal-based pudding, described as a ‘super sausage’ by food historian F. Marian McNeill, inThe Scots Kitchen (1929). It forms the centrepiece of Burns Night suppers, held on or around 25 January to commemorate the Scottish national poet Robert Burns. Burns dedicated an entire poem to the ‘Great chieftain o’ the pudding race’, but the origins of this traditional dish may be more international than you’d expect. (What is Burns Night and where can you celebrate it?) Origins One of the earliest written references to haggis appears in a 13th-century poem by English knight Walter of Bibbesworth, designed to teach noble children French. It’s believed that the word ‘haggis’ is derived from the French verb hacher or hager (to hack), with hagëis meaning chopped or minced matter. As far back as Ancient Rome, people have stuffed parts of animals such as wombs and udders — the Romans put meat and pine nuts, or sea urchins in them, respectively. And throughout Europe and beyond there are variations of offal and cereal puddings, from Icelandic slátur (made with sheep’s stomach) to the ghameh (stuffed cow intestines) of Lebanon. In 1771, Scottish writer Tobias Smollett described haggis as ‘a mess of minced lights [lungs], livers, suet, oatmeal, onions and pepper, enclosed in a sheep’s stomach’. But as McNeill notes, the contents of haggis have varied over time. Seventeenth-century cook Robert May (another Englishman) created three haggis recipes, two of which contain no offal or meat (besides suet) and one that’s laden with cream, raisins and herbs. During Lent, when some people avoided meat, May suggested cooking the stuffing in a napkin or bag, rather than a sheep’s stomach, and omitting the suet. Scottish cook Susanna MacIver included beef, liver, oatmeal and mixed spices in her 18th-century recipe for ‘A Good Scotch Haggies’. How it’s made Smollett’s description of haggis is similar to modern recipes, but making haggis from scratch is not for the faint-hearted. McNeill explains that first the sheep’s stomach needs to be thoroughly cleaned in cold water, before being turned inside out, scalded (briefly immersed in boiling water), then scraped with a knife. It is then soaked overnight in cold, salted water. The liver, heart and lungs are cleaned and boiled for 90 minutes, ‘letting the windpipe hang over the side of the pot to let out any impurities’. After the gristle and pipes have been removed, the offal can be grated or finely chopped. Toasted oatmeal, chopped onions, suet and a good dose of pepper and salt are mixed with the offal, then the filling is moistened with stock. The stomach is filled just over halfway to allow for the stuffing to expand. It’s sewn up and boiled in water or stock for three hours. McNeill cautions, ‘As soon as [the haggis] begins to swell, prick it all over with a large needle to prevent its bursting.’ She adds that haggis is traditionally served with clapshot – mashed swede and potatoes seasoned with pepper. Where to try it 1. The Scottish Cafe & Restaurant, EdinburghThe full Scottish breakfast here includes a classic haggis, alongside quality Scottish produce including bacon, sausage and eggs, and you’ll find a non-meat version available in the vegetarian Scottish breakfast too. In keeping with tradition, the cafe and restaurant hosts an annual Burns Night supper, where diners can enjoy a three-course seasonal Scottish meal and a dram of whisky before live music and ceilidh dancing. 2. Mharsanta, GlasgowHaggis is celebrated all year long at this bar and restaurant in Glasgow’s Merchant City. From haggis scotch egg with mustard mayo to chicken Balmoral (haggis-stuffed chicken breast wrapped in pancetta and served with a creamy whisky sauce) there’s something haggis-related on the regular menu to suit most tastes, including vegetarian options. Nowhere near Glasgow? You can find a recipe for Mharsanta’s haggis lasagne on the website. 3. Stravaigin, GlasgowNamed after an old Scots word that means ‘to wander aimlessly with intent’, Stravaigin goes the whole hog (or sheep?) by making its own haggis. Available in starter or main course sizes, it comes with a side of neeps and tatties (swede and potatoes). The restaurant’s menu is internationally influenced, so a haggis starter could be followed by Jamaican coconut and scotch bonnet curry or Shetland mussels in a Malaysian rendang broth.

Why the best way to see the Pacific nation of Palau is by water,"National Geographic content straight to your inbox—sign up for our popular newsletters here An aquatic adventure in the western Pacific island nation of Palau — home to over 300 islands — highlights the reward of protecting the planet’s marine ecosystems. Sinking into the warm, aquamarine water, I feel the tug of the current immediately. Activating my leg muscles to kick against it, I scope out a suitable spot to hook into the reef without damaging it and give my buoyancy control device (BCD) a few pumps of air to lift me (and most importantly, my fins) above the coral. Here I hover, attached to the hook by a coil lanyard, and enjoy the show. Act one begins with a shiver of reef sharks parading along the edge of the reef just metres from me. A battery of black-striped barracudas enters from stage left, trailed by an enormous Napoleon wrasse and a school of canary yellow and white pyramid butterflyfish, seemingly unbothered by the volume of predators in their midst. During a brief interlude in shark activity, I spot a moray eel extending its head from a crevice in the reef, flashing its needle-like teeth as it opens and closes its mouth to pass oxygenated water though its gills. Waving my hand over a head of hard coral, a trio of Christmas tree worms suck their colourful fronds into the small burrows they’ve bored into their accommodating host. After a while we unhook and drift across a sublime slice of the reef festooned with corals in a riot of colours and textures. We pass several hawksbill turtles, while redtooth triggerfish are constant companions, their crescent-shaped tails trailing in the current as they flap their cerulean-blue fins in a mesmerising bird-like motion. Divers’ delight Climbing back into the speedboat nearly an hour later, I wonder if I’ve peaked too early by spending my first morning in Palau diving Blue Corner, the pint-sized Micronesian nation’s most famous dive site. But my second dive that morning, at German Channel, is similarly spectacular. Blasted and dredged out of Palau’s barrier reef in 1908 during its German administration (1899-1914), the artificial channel has been reborn as a hangout for ‘big stuff’ including sharks, turtles and magnificent manta rays. I admire a pair of rays performing a hypnotic courtship dance on my second dive here, twisting and turning through the blue. The volume and diversity of marine life at both sites is gloriously abundant, and amid the increasing global popularity of scuba diving— PADI alone certifies over a million divers per year — it’s a rare treat for my small group to enjoy both dive spots to ourselves. The lack of crowds is partly due to the timing of my visit in August, the peak of the country’s low (rainy) season. But there’s excellent diving year-round in Palau, which lies outside the region’s typhoon belt, protecting it from most tropical storms. Another reason for my exclusive access to Palau’s top dive sites is the Four Seasons Explorer, a luxury vessel launched in Palau in 2023 after two decades cruising the Maldives on liveaboard itineraries. Unlike a standard liveaboard with a fixed length of stay, this 128ft, three-deck catamaran with 11 guest cabins offers daily embarkations in its new island home, with speedboat transfers usually taking under an hour to reach its cruising location. The Explorer spends most of its weekly cruising itinerary in Palau’s UNESCO World Heritage-listed Rock Islands, a jewel box of some 400 emerald jungle-cloaked limestone islets rising from a dreamy palette of blue waters directly south of Koror island, Palau’s main commercial and tourism hub. With most of the vessel’s Palauan staff currently in training in the Maldives, the 22-person crew on board during my week-long stay are all transplants from the two Four Seasons resorts there. Many are Maldivian, including one of my dive guides, Hassan Ali, who laments the declining quality of coral reefs in his homeland following successive coral bleaching events. “We see more mantas in the Maldives, but the reefs in Palau are in better condition,” he says as we emerge from an incredible wall dive at Siaes Corner on my second day. Later in the week, at Turtle Cove, I’m captivated by a pair of electric clams emitting a bright white glow from reflective cells in their crimson lips. In Ulong Channel, on day four, I drift over a field of lettuce corals resembling giant green roses. Later that afternoon, I take a short speedboat ride to admire a collection of rock art painted under an overhang on Ulong Island more than 3,000 years ago. Tucking into a fresh tuna poke bowl for lunch midway through my stay, it occurs to me that the plastic bottle I spot bobbing by the Explorer as we motor to a new anchoring is the first piece of marine debris that I’ve encountered in Palau. “Palauans are very proud of what we have here,” says Eric Whipps, a local businessman who’s holidaying with his family aboard the Explorer during my visit. “You’ll also notice on land that Palau is very clean,” the recently certified divemaster tells me as we snack on slices of fresh watermelon between dives. The balance of nature Thought to have been settled by seafarers from Indonesia or the Philippines about 4,000 years ago, Palau, which celebrates its 30th year of independence in 2024, is a pioneer in environmental protection. In 2009 it created the world’s first shark sanctuary, and in 2017 it launched the Palau Pledge, a world-first initiative requiring visitors to sign a promise to tread gently upon entry. Earlier this year, it became the first nation to ratify the UN’s High Seas Treaty allowing for the creation of marine sanctuaries beyond national boundaries. A deep respect for the environment and the interconnectedness of humans and nature is a cornerstone of Palauan culture, says Palauan guide Fonzareli ‘Fonzie’ Shickich when he meets me at Koror’s marina one morning to lead me on a tour of Babeldaob, Palau’s lush, sparsely developed main island that’s connected to Koror by bridge. It’s one of several activities that can be arranged during an Explorer stay. “Everything we do is linked to the tide,” explains Fonzie, who, with his easy smile and curly black hair tied up with a traditional carved-wood hair pin, has a different kind of charisma to the Happy Days character he was named after. “Babies are usually born at high tide — often pregnant women will hold on [if the tide is still coming in] for good luck,” he continues. “When someone passes away, the tide is usually going out.” The significance of the tide is even showcased on the Palauan flag, Fonzie adds, which features a full yellow moon rising above the blue tide. As we make the scenic, winding drive to the mysterious collection of stone monoliths at the island’s northern tip, which is just over an hour from Koror, Eric’s earlier comment rings true as we pass yet another ‘keep Palau pristine’ sign. There’s another one at the entrance to Ngardmau Waterfall, about 20 minutes south of the monoliths. Here, Fonzie and I hike down though a steamy tract of lush jungle to cool off under a vast curtain of water tumbling from a volcanic shelf almost 100ft above. A visit to Koror’s small but interesting Belau National Museum — housing artefacts including vibrant glass beads that formed part of a complex traditional exchange system — rounds off our adventure. Beyond the reef A serene sunrise hatha yoga session hosted on the Explorer’s sundeck as white-tailed tropicbirds fly by sets me up for another day of diving. Later in the afternoon, I’m shuttled to shore from our anchoring in Airai, at the southern tip of Babeldaob, to meet Palauan local Velma Obak. Dressed in a traditional woven pandanus bra and hibiscus fibre skirt, Velma leads us along a historic stone pathway to a traditional bai (chief’s meeting house). About two centuries old, the thatched-roofed, A-frame wooden hall is one of four traditional bai still standing in Palau. Here, Velma shares some of the stories behind the paintings covering its exterior. The battle scenes can be misleading, she says, explaining that ancient Palauan conflicts saw minimal bloodshed — wars were won by taking the head of a target on the enemy side. Peeking inside, I notice a fruit bat painted underneath the head of the door. “It’s a symbol of respect, because when a bat lands upside down, it’s in a position of submission,” Velma explains. Maintaining its rich cultural traditions, both tangible and intangible, hasn’t been easy for Palau. Following Imperial Japan’s 1914 annexation of Palau, Japanese migrants outnumbered Palauans by three to one by 1937. Palau went on to see some of the grisliest battles of the Pacific War fought in its territory, with only about 5,300 ethnic Palauans surviving the carnage. On a grey afternoon towards the end of my trip, I plunge into the depths of the Rock Islands with cruise director and dive guide Angela Gitaprakasa to explore the Iro, a 469ft-long Japanese Navy oil tanker sitting upright on the sandy seabed, 130ft below the surface. Descending alongside its coral-encrusted bow, we arrive at a gaping hole ripped by an Allied torpedo. Amazingly it wasn’t the torpedo that sunk the Iro, but the ensuing bombing campaign that left holes in the deck. While exploring, we startle an octopus that swiftly shapeshifts into an impressive imitation of a corroded hunk of metal. Another legacy of Palau’s Japanese era that’s outlasted its three decades of post-war US administration is its cuisine. Fresh local reef fish sashimi is a menu staple in the casual restaurants of Koror, and also makes several appearances on the Explorer’s international menu during my stay. A breakfast highlight, meanwhile, is ‘Kaali’s mama egg scramble’ — a Palauan family recipe shared by the eponymous member of the Explorer’s land-based staff. Disembarking the Explorer for the last time amid the trumpeting of conch horns, I leave Palau with a new appreciation for raw fish, island life and the power of environmental stewardship.

Everything you need to know about Guatemala's Semana Santa,"Listed by UNESCO as Intangible World Heritage, the country's Holy Week is one of the world’s most exuberant Easter celebrations — here’s what you can expect. The seven days leading up to Easter, Semana Santa — or ‘Holy Week’ — is Guatemala’s most celebrated event, drawing tens of thousands of visitors every year. Blending Catholic practices introduced by the Spanish with centuries-old Maya traditions, it’s evolved into a distinctly Guatemalan spectacle. Expect huge, noisy processions, ornate religious floats and intricate street art crafted from sawdust — a hectic fusion of faith, art and community. What makes Semana Santa special? Guatemala’s Holy Week has been inscribed on the UNESCO list of Intangible Cultural Heritage. What sets it apart from others around the world is its scale, artistry and level of community involvement. The processions feature massive wooden andas, or floats, measuring up to 80ft long and weighing as much as a tonne, topped with huge, brightly painted carvings depicting religious figures and scenes from the passion of Christ. These massive works of art have become a source of national pride, and sculptors and painters compete for the honour of creating them. Up to 100 cucuruchos, devout masked bearers dressed in long purple tunics and pointed conical hats, carry the andas on their shoulders, requiring exceptional strength and coordination to navigate the often cobbled streets. The processions move slowly, accompanied by beating drums, mournful brass bands and pine-scented clouds of copal incense. What are the alfombras? Guatemala’s famous alfombras often steal the show. These intricate and ephemeral floral works of art are laid out in the streets like carpets as part of the festivities by religious groups and communities from across the country. Made of brightly coloured sawdust, leaves, flowers and small offerings, they feature a blend of Catholic and Maya imagery, biblical scenes and intricate patterns and symbols. Despite taking months to plan and hours or even days to construct, the alfombras are soon destroyed by the thousands of feet that march over them — a poignant symbol of sacrifice and impermanence. Where are the best places to experience Semana Santa? The crown jewel of Guatemalan Semana Santa celebrations takes place in the colonial city of Antigua Guatemala. A UNESCO World Heritage Site, it hosts the most elaborate processions, with thousands of participants, alfombras stretching for many blocks and vibrant paper decorations draped from doors and windows. Guatemala City also offers impressive festivities, particularly in the Historic Centre, where processions and alfombras fill the streets while participants feast on snacks from street food vendors and set off firecrackers. In the highland city of Quetzaltenango, locals build arches made of aromatic corozo palm leaves for the parades to walk under, and share pan de yema — a sweet bread made with egg yolks. For a less intense Holy Week experience, visit the smaller towns around Lake Atitlán in Sololá or Chichicastenango in Quiché, where you can see the same rituals with fewer crowds. What are the must-see parades in Antigua? In Antigua Guatemala, Semana Santa celebrations start on Palm Sunday with a parade re-enacting Jesus’s entry into Jerusalem, complete with worshippers carrying palm fronds and singing joyful hymns. On Maundy Thursday, the city commemorates the Last Supper, and groups start creating their alfombras, often staying up all night to finish them in time for the Good Friday processions. These begin at around 4am and carry on late into the night, with bearers dressed in black and bands playing melancholy music to mourn the crucifixion. This sombre mood continues throughout Holy Saturday, until about 10pm when churches begin celebrating the Resurrection. Easter Sunday’s parades are festive and triumphant, with ecstatic crowds, upbeat music and fireworks. How can I plan a successful Semana Santa visit? Expect crowds, road closures and travel disruption during Holy Week — but this is all part of the experience. Organise your transport and accommodation early, since Antigua Guatemala and other popular destinations get booked up very quickly and prices shoot up, too. Comfortable walking shoes are essential and be sure to take care of your personal belongings when moving in the more crowded areas. Respect is key when attending Semana Santa. While it’s a public event, it’s also considered deeply sacred by local people. It’s advisable to dress modestly, particularly during processions or when visiting a church. Don’t step on the alfombras ahead of time — they’re works of devotion and need to be kept perfect until the procession arrives. Photography is usually tolerated, but be respectful of people who don’t want to be photographed — always ask permission first — and don’t take pictures of mourners in emotional moments. For a local’s insight into the events, consider booking a guided tour or a photography walk. Where can I learn more? To learn more about the festival and see a wide variety of religious artifacts and art, check out Antigua Guatemala's Museo de la Semana Santa (Holy Week Museum). Located inside a crumbling former Spanish convent, its displays include examples of alfombras (smaller than the real thing, but just as intricate), robes and costumes, incense burners, icons, artworks and carvings of religious figures from the andas. During Lent, the museum also runs an alfombra-making workshop. Information signs throughout the museum are in both Spanish and English.

This Japanese region is home to a unique fusion cuisine—here's what to know,"National Geographic content straight to your inbox—sign up for our popular newsletters here Tim Anderson’s new book, Hokkaido, is inspired by Japan’s northernmost prefecture, where Western influences and Indigenous cooking create a cuisine like no other. What makes the food culture of Hokkaido unique? The blend of cultural influences. I was struck by the similarities to Wisconsin, where I’m from. There’s that Midwestern-style agriculture, focusing on crops like corn and potato, and dairy farming. During the Meiji Restoration from the 1870s, the Japanese government enlisted Middle European and Midwestern American agriculturalists to advise on Western farming methods, because these regions share a similar climate and terrain to Hokkaido. That’s why you can find old German beer halls like those in Milwaukee, some even serving German potato salad. A piece of home, but in Japan. And, of course, there’s the important influence of the Indigenous Ainu people, who migrated centuries ago from northern Russia. That’s why I wanted to spotlight Ainu food. I spoke to a lot of Ainu chefs and cooks, but also businesspeople and craftspeople, as well spending time at the National Ainu Museum. How does the landscape and climate affect the cuisine? As it’s a snowy and volcanic region, the ecosystems contribute to the seaweed’s flavour, helping to produce top-quality kombu. This also means delicious seafood: crab, scallop and salmon. Seafood from Hokkaido features on menus at high-end establishments across Japan, but it’s even fresher and cheaper at the source. Hokkaido isn’t hot or wet enough to be a rice-growing region, so it imports a lot of rice from the rest of Japan, as well as from China, Korea and Taiwan. Even before the Meiji Restoration, the Ainu traded seafood and kombu for rice. Native grains and wheat have also, unsurprisingly, played a key role in the cuisine. Due to the abundance of wheat, wheat ramen is one of the most popular Hokkaido dishes. Hops grow wild along railroads, and the availability of hops and barley explain products like Sapporo beer. Grains like millet and pearl barley, as well as legumes like soybeans, are used to bulk out rice. What other key ingredients feature in the local cuisine? Plants like wild garlic and butterbur, often foraged. The latter has giant leaves (used as shelter for korpokkur gnomes, according to Ainu folklore), which are grilled, dried or used in soups. There’s also confectionery using Hokkaido milk and butter, like milk butter ice cream and milk bread, as well as chocolates, biscuits, cheesecakes and crackers, often also using local wheat. There’s a real focus on natural produce, so these confections are popular as omiyage (gifting souvenirs). Even though it’s a wintry place, there’s great fruit, which you might not expect, such as sweet melons, strawberries and grapes. Plants from the multicoloured flower fields, like lavender, are used to flavour everything from shaved ice to coffees. Are there other cultural traditions that influence food customs in Hokkaido? Spirituality. In Ainu culture, there are kamuy (spirit deities) within certain living things, elements and even tools, as well as kamuy that oversee some creatures. When you take food from the environment, by hunting, foraging or fishing, it’s important to give thanks to the appropriate kamuy. This translates into a respect for crops — for example, wild garlic is cut above the root to make sure it grows back. This is practically important, too, in a region that has little vegetation for more than half the year. What are some of the most memorable dishes you’ve enjoyed across the region? At Washo Market in Kushiro, dozens of in-season seafood varieties are used to make the most amazing breakfast dishes, such as a seafood rice bowl. I love the spaghetti katsu at Izumiya restaurant and, in the evening, the robata joints serve up small plates of grilled local seafood. Zangi [Hokkaido-style fried chicken] and thin, crinkly noodles in a light soy sauce broth with lard are also great Kushiro specialities. I’d recommend the traditional Ainu food and fusion plates in the Ainu village at Lake Akan. At Abashiri, a former prison, the museum cafe serves the old prison menu for lunch, and it’s delicious. Another must is chanchanyaki, a fisherman’s dish of salmon cooked on a hot plate with cabbage, bean sprouts and onions. How’s the food scene changing in Hokkaido? There’s more opportunity to learn about Ainu food now. The National Ainu Museum offers cooking classes and has small farms growing traditional crops. There are also a few more Ainu restaurants; in 2005, there was only one Ainu restaurant in Sapporo, run out of a family home, which closed two years later due to lack of interest. There are some issues around appropriation of Ainu art and decor, but it’s great to see renewed interest in Ainu food culture. I hope people try the Ainu recipes in the book — they’re accessible and tasty.

7 ways to embrace winter in Copenhagen,"A winter visit to Denmark’s snow-dusted capital opens the door to local delights and offbeat experiences like winter swimming and urban skiing. When snow falls in Copenhagen, the city’s cobbled streets, turreted castles and colourful homes feel like something out of a fairytale, making the colder months the perfect time of year to discover the cosy character of the Danish capital. Take inspiration from the locals and enjoy a cold swim in the harbour, queue up for traditional festive cakes at one of the city’s excellent bakeries or race down the world’s first ski slope built on top of a power plant. It's also a great time to discover Danish culture in the city's impressive museums and galleries, ideal for those looking to keep in the heat. Here are seven experiences not to miss on a winter visit to Copenhagen. 1. Enjoy the ‘great Danish cake-off’ The Danish version of Mardi Gras, Fastelavn, usually falls in February, but will be taking place on 2 March in 2025. To celebrate this annual event, bakeries create a special cream-filled bun called a fastelavnsbolle. These decadent buns are sold from January onwards, and in recent years, the occasion has turned into a wild bun-fest, where gourmet bakers try to outdo each other with the most lavish creations. Go bakery-hopping around the city’s best spots — Juno, Hart and Københavns Bageri are just three to try — and see if you can decide which treat is best. 2. Dare to try winter swimming Challenge yourself to swim with the Danes in Copenhagen’s freezing-cold harbour. Although it may take the courage of a Viking to jump in, winter swimming has become hugely popular in the city, and fans of the activity say it helps them fight stress, reduces high blood pressure and builds resilience. At Copenhot, located in up-and-coming Refshaleøen, there are saunas and hot tubs to keep you warm on a cold day, as well as a cold plunge pool to cool off in. Alternatively, visit the city’s newest swanky floating spa, Glæcier, on a Tuesday evening for a saunagus — a guided sauna experience with music and scented oils. 3. Explore the city under the stars Take advantage of Copenhagen’s long winter nights and go stargazing. The Round Tower hosts special winter stargazing nights in its historic observatory in the heart of the city. Copenhagen also hosts its own Light Festival every February, with neon-lit installations that shine brightly against the pitch-black skies. Experience this colourful event on a guided tour, canal cruise or by taking on The Light Run — a scenic 7km race through Copenhagen’s lit-up streets. 4. Meet the locals for dinner Copenhagen has a strong culture of communal dining, with many venues featuring long shared tables where you can sit and chat to new friends over a family-style dinner. At the beloved culture house and community centre Absalon, dinner is served at 6pm every night of the week. If you want to stay on afterwards, the centre has a bar, and also hosts silent discos, life drawing classes and ceramics workshops. Nordhus, the city’s newest culture house, serves family-style, veggie-packed communal dinners from Tuesday to Sunday. Or, to the south, Kanalhuset in history-packed Christianshavn is another classic communal dining spot. 5. Try urban skiing and ice skating Copenhagen is one of the only places in the world where you don’t have to leave the urban centre to hit the slopes. Copenhill, designed by local architect Bjarke Ingels Group (BIG), is a recreational facility, hiking path and ski spot on top of a waste-to-energy plant. The slope is suitable for first-time skiers as well as experts, and there’s also a freestyle park and slalom course to try. If you prefer skates to skis, ice skating on one of the city’s traditional outdoor rinks is a great way to get active. Rent skates at Kongens Nytorv or Broens Ice Skating Rink and spend an hour gliding around the floodlit ice. 6. Discover Danish culture Hygge, a Danish concept that embodies a feeling of cosiness and taking time to enjoy life’s simple pleasures, is top of mind at Design Museum Danmark this winter, where a new exhibition focuses on ceramic mugs. This exhibit looks at the design process behind ceramics and showcases mugs from an array of inspiring artists. Head to the museum’s beautiful Format café afterwards to enjoy a mug of hot chocolate. Or visit Glyptoteket, the city’s art and sculpture museum, where amid the beautiful marble busts, French impressionist paintings and Egyptian mummies, you’ll find a winter garden complete with palm trees that feels like a mini oasis. 7. Take a literary tour Copenhagen was the home of legendary fairytale writer Hans Christian Andersen and 19th century theologian and philosopher Søren Kierkegaard — so, naturally, the city has plenty of stories to tell. At The Black Diamond library and culture centre, you can visit exhibitions and see historic manuscripts from famous writers. The Karen Blixen Museum, located at the celebrated Danish author’s childhood home in Rungstedlund, just north of the city, allows you to see where she wrote some of her most famous works. Meanwhile, the Copenhagen University Library, dating to 1479, has opened its doors to visitors this winter, letting travellers marvel at the library's grand book hall. The city is also packed with bookshops for more modern tastes, with shops like Thiemers Magasin, Books & Company and Politikens Boghal selling books in English.
