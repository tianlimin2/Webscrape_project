2025-01-25T22:09:24.263341,What are the key principles of sustainable tourism?,"The key principles of sustainable tourism include:

1. Tourism as an economic factor: By choosing accommodations and businesses that operate sustainably, tourist money can support local economies and fair labor practices. 

2. Preserving resources: Sustainable tourism promotes use of renewable energy and efficient use of resources. This includes upcycling furniture and favoring organic farming for food provisions.

3. Promote nature and species conservation: Active steps are taken to conserve local biodiversity, such as creating gardens of native plants, using natural pest control methods and supporting natural reserves. 

4. Authentic experiences: Eco-travel promotes experiencing a destination in authentic way by interacting with the locals and understanding their culture, which further helps in preserving local traditions and economies. 

5. Education: Sustainable travel often includes educational aspects, encouraging travelers to learn more about the local environment, culture, and the importance of conservation.

6. Vision for the future: Sustainable travel takes into consideration not just the immediate impact of the visit, but the long-term effects on the environment, economy and communities. 

Furthermore, it involves strategic planning, collaboration across stakeholder groups, and well-formulated policies and standards. It champions the use of data to influence decision-making in relation to conservation and better visitor management in protected areas. It also emphasizes the role of sustainable tourism in supporting rural communities and indigenous populations.","['On our blog we often talk about HOW to travel sustainable. Today, though, we want to talk about WHY it is important. We’ll give away this much: it’s not just about protecting the environment. Ultimately, sustainable travel benefits you personally. #1 Tourism as an economic factor The tourism industry is an important economic factor – in some countries it is the most important. Your vacation sets your money in motion, helping to redistribute wealth and pay workers. Hotels are often large businesses with many employees, subcontractors, suppliers, etc. who also benefit from a financially successful hotel. Unfortunately, not all hotels are sustainable and socially responsible, and often your money does not benefit your vacation destination at all. You may travel to a hotel in Thailand and your money ends up with an investor in the US or Japan. Some hotels employ seasonal workers who live in shabby accommodations (I was told this for a German island, for example). By consciously choosing a hotel that operates in a sustainable and usually fair manner, you ensure that your money really benefits the region and creates fair jobs. Support fair labor practices in hotels One example is the Green City Hotel Vauban in Freiburg, Germany. This sustainable city hotel is an integration project, and half of all employees are people with physical and/or mental disabilities. The hotel has deep roots in Freiburg. Its shareholders are the Vereinigung Freiburger Sozialarbeit e.V. and the Freiburger Stadtbau GmbH. Even abroad, you have many opportunities to use your purchasing power to help other people (instead of supporting their exploitation). At our Green PearlsⓇ partner Farmhouse Smiling Gecko in Cambodia, the luxury resort ensures the financing of the Smiling Gecko NGO’s training centers, school and organic farm, and also serves as a training center and employer itself. #2 preserving resources You probably already know this: Planet B does not exist. The idea that we could someday completely deplete our planet of all its resources, destroy all animal and plant species (and perhaps even entire populations), and live on Mars from then on is NOT realistic! Fossil resources such as oil, coal and natural gas are finite. This means that they are taken from the Earth and then they are gone. Theoretically, these resources will eventually reform, but in the case of oil, for example, it takes at least 10,000 years for new oil to form from dead plant matter and plankton. We should all be aware that what we consume today will not be available to our children, grandchildren, great-grandchildren and future generations. Renewable energy in the hospitality industry In our opinion, one of the requirements for a sustainable hotel is to run on renewable energy. The least you can do is get 100% green electricity (something you can easily do at home by simply switching your electricity provider). But many hotels go further. For example, our partner Hotel Milano Scala was the first Zero Emission Hotel in Italy. It is powered by geothermal energy, a renewable energy source that “significantly reduces greenhouse gas emissions,” according to the Ministry of the Environment, Climate and Energy. Other hotels and residences rely on their own combined heat and power plants, heat pump technologies, photovoltaic and solar thermal systems, and heat recovery measures to reduce their own consumption of fossil resources while minimizing CO2 emissions. Upcycling and organic Conserving resources is not only about energy, but also about buildings and furnishings. The HUBERTUS Mountain Refugio Allgäu recently renovated its hotel rooms using a sustainable upcycling concept. Instead of buying new furniture, the existing solid wood furniture in the rooms was simply dismantled, the (outdated) decorations removed and the furniture reworked. The new composition created modern furniture without cutting down any trees! (You can learn more about this in this YouTube video by owner Marc Traubel and interior designer Sarah Stapelfeld) Throughout Biohotel Grafenast you will find sustainable and natural materials such as solid wood and local stone. The eco-friendly hotel is also committed to organic farming and uses only organic food – whenever possible, directly from the region and from the hotel’s own “Sehnsuchtsgarten” (garden of longing). Short delivery distances mean fewer greenhouse gases, and the absence of pesticides helps preserve biodiversity. #3 Promote nature and species conservation Which brings us to the next argument: sustainable travel supports conservation. Take, for example, the Casa León Royal Retreat in Gran Canaria. This small boutique hotel in the interior of the island has created a garden of native plants on its 10,000-square-meter property and uses only natural pest control. Here you can see a variety of small animals, such as the Canary Island bullfinch – the original form of the domesticated canary! The hotel uses a rainwater cistern system for irrigation. In another sustainable initiative, the family that owns Casa León Royal Retreat has leased a 40,000-square-foot piece of forest in the Balkans that is maintained but still largely untouched. This has created another protected area for animals and plants in this world, which also helps the climate. #4 Experience the country and its people in an authentic way Sustainable travel means going off the beaten track and visiting places away from the usual mass tourism destinations. This gives you a real opportunity to experience the country you are visiting and get to know the locals. Albergi Diffusi is saving villages in Italy In Italy, the Albergo Diffuso movement has helped save Italian villages from decay. An Albergo Diffuso is a hotel spread over several buildings in a village. You live among the locals. Our Green PearlsⓇ partner Relais del Maro is a prime example. Owner Elena Scalambrin converted several of her family’s commercial and residential buildings into a 4-star hotel. Guests arrive at the main house with a reception for dinner (and the pool), but otherwise stay in lovingly decorated rooms in the middle of the village community. The hotel has helped keep the village bakery and other local businesses alive. Here you will be able to experience the real Liguria and see the positive effects of sustainable tourism at first hand. #5 Learning to love nature “In the end, we will conserve only what we love” – Baba Dioum, Senegalese forestry engineer and conservationist It is easy to understand Baba Dioum’s famous quote, delivered at a biodiversity conference in India in 1968. As we showed in our blog post on insect extinction, many animals and plants simply do not have a strong “lobby”. We think of some bugs and algae as expendable. It is only when we understand the important role they play that we learn to love them and work to conserve them. Guided hikes in the Allgäu At Hotel Das Rübezahl in Füssen, you have the opportunity to discover nature with the hotel’s own hiking guide. “Bergbaschdi” will take you into the mountains and show you the flora and fauna. You are sure to discover things you would otherwise have missed. (Read more in our interview with the hiking concierge) Experience glaciers live in Switzerland Glaciers are also very interesting. These “eternal” masses of ice are the largest reservoirs of fresh water on our planet, and they are in danger of disappearing! Fabienne Anthamatten of the Hotel Bella Vista Zermatt can tell you all about it. Her hotel has an 8,000-year-old larch tree that she found on a former glacier field. This means that the trunk was preserved in the ice for several thousand years and has now been uncovered. On a trip to the glaciers, you can admire the fascinating masses of ice (there are still many kilometers left) and better understand the connections to global warming. #6 Have a vision – and think about the future Just being in the present moment is a beautiful mindfulness exercise. But you should also have a vision in your life. A vision is a motivating, positive idea about the future. And that’s what sustainable travel is all about. According to the UN, sustainable tourism is: “Tourism that takes full account of its current and future economic, social and environmental impacts.” So it’s thinking about the NOW as well as the FUTURE and taking responsibility for it. If you can do that, you’re doing pretty well. And what better way to learn how to do that and develop your own vision of the future than to travel the world sustainably and be inspired by other visionaries?

By drawing visitors out of tourism hotspots to more remote regions, protected area tourism can bring new benefits to rural communities and indigenous populations.While protected areas provide significant economic value, there tends to be little data to actually back this up. Without reliable and quantifiable evidence, governments and communities may undervalue these natural areas and the benefits they deliver. As a result, important visitor management and conservation activities may be overlooked. Without these types of sustainability measures in place, tourism growth in protected areas can end up harming their fragile environments. \n\n\n\nOur Role \n\n\n\nOne destination focused on developing sustainable tourism in its protected areas is Panama. The country’s 121 protected areas cover over 6.2 million hectares of rainforests, coastal reefs, and other sensitive habitats. An increasing number of visitors come to these areas for nature-based tourism experiences, such as trekking, snorkeling, rock climbing, and birdwatching.In 2017, Sustainable Travel International conducted an economic impact study to determine the value of these natural areas. For this study, our team examined the economic benefits generated by tourism activities within Panama’s protected areas as a way to measure their value.We began by reviewing Panama’s existing tourism data. This included more general statistics such as national visitor arrivals, protected areas statistics, and public use plans.To supplement this data, we collected more specific data on tourism revenues linked to protected areas. \xa0We surveyed businesses in Panama’s protected areas and their surrounding buffer zones. Five protected areas were included in this pilot study: Camino de Cruces National Park, Altos De Campana National Park, La Amistad International Park, Chagres National Park, and Soberanía National Park. Survey participants were asked to provide information about their business, including the services they offer and their revenues.In addition to collecting data from businesses, our team also interviewed visitors to these areas. Through these interviews, we were able to gain a better understanding of who is visiting Panama’s protected areas, what they are doing, and where they are spending their money. \xa0\xa0\xa0The study findings paint a fuller picture of the different groups that are operating in and benefiting from Panama’s protected areas. It also quantifies the economic value of protected area tourism. An added benefit of this research approach is that it provides data not only on impacts at the national level, but also on the value generated for local communities.The real impact of this data lies in its potential to influence destination planning and decision-making. By demonstrating the value of protected areas to the tourism industry, local communities, and the country as a whole, this data helps reinforce the importance of caring for these areas. We hope this data incentivizes improved conservation and leads to better visitor management in protected areas.Header Photo Credit: Billtacular via\xa0Flickr \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProject Type \n\n\n\nDestination: Panama \n\n\n\nRegion: Central America \n\n\n\nLocation \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDates\n \n\n\n\n2017 \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOur Partners \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExplore More Destination Projects \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNet Zero Training for Barbados\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAssessing the Carrying Capacity of\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSt. Kitts Destination Guardians\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPalau: Carbon Neutral Tourism Destination\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDeveloping Sustainable Tourism Initiatives in\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMonitoring Lenga Tree Reforestation in\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSustainable Tourism Course for Small\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInvesting in the Development of\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSustainable Tourism Enterprise Program for\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMesoamerican Reef Tourism Initiative (MARTI)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKawésqar Community Tourism & Empowerment\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRestoring the Base Torres Trail\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProtect the Places You Love \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHelp conserve our planet’s most vulnerable destinations and empower the people who live there.

2025-01-25T22:09:34.273052,How can travelers reduce their environmental impact during hotel stays?,"Based on the information provided, travelers can reduce their environmental impact during hotel stays by:

1. Choose Sustainable Hotels: Opt for hotels that operate sustainably. For instance, hotels that run on renewable energy significantly reduce greenhouse gas emissions.

2. Use Renewable Energy: Staying in facilities that utilize renewable energy sources like geothermal energy, solar thermal systems, and photovoltaic systems can save resource consumption and reduce CO2 emissions.

3. Upcycle: Choose hotels that conserve resources in their buildings and furnishings, opting for sustainable upcycling concepts in the renovation of their rooms and using sustainable and natural materials in decor.

4. Natural Pest Control: You can support nature and species conservation by staying at hotels that use natural pest control or encourage biodiversity.

5. Support Fair Labor: Stay in hotels that are fair to their workers, by prioritizing properties that provide fair jobs and pay, reducing exploitation and supporting the local economy.

6. Conserve Water: Select hotels that promote water conservation efforts. For example, some hotels utilize rainwater cistern systems for irrigation.

7. Organic Food: Choose accommodations that serve organic food sourced from local farms. This reduces the carbon footprint associated with transporting goods long distances.

8. Promote Nature Conservation: Staying in hotels that actively take steps to protect local flora and fauna helps to support nature conservation efforts.

9. Responsible Tourism: Stay in accommodations supporting indigenous communities and local businesses as a way of ensuring that your vacation finances are plowed back into the region which you're visiting.

10. Green Electricity: Some hotels generate their own electricity, conserving energy and reducing their environmental footprint. This can be from onsite photovoltaic systems or other renewable energy sources. Opt for such hotels.

Each of these actions can significantly lessen the environmental impact of hotel stays, assisting in the preservation of our planet's resources for future generations.","['On our blog we often talk about HOW to travel sustainable.

A question many of our Green PearlsⓇ partners ask themselves all the time. As a result, hotels and resorts have implemented a variety of measures to reduce electricity, water and heating costs, as well as waste and CO₂ emissions. Many of these measures can also be implemented at home! The beauty is that it often only takes one step to live greener for many years to come. Going green – Planning and implementation Living sustainably involves so many things… Do you sometimes feel like you are inconsistent, getting bogged down, and maybe paying too much attention to the wrong things? You’re not alone! And rest assured, it’s almost impossible to be perfect in all aspects. But from time to time, it’s worth taking a look at your own behavior and identifying where you can improve. To that end, let’s take a look at a few areas of the home to see what improvements can be made and which ones will have the biggest impact. 10 tips for a more sustainable home #1: Power supply Before we look at the biggest power consumers in your home, you can start by looking at the sources from which you draw electricity. One of the easiest tips: Switch to green power! Switching to a new power provider is easy – particularly since it’s part of the provider’s service to help you do so. When making the switch, make sure it is truly green electricity, 100% renewable and not nuclear or coal-fired. You can find comparisons of green power providers in your area on the internet. You will also find the electricity tariffs there – green electricity is usually a bit more expensive, but if you implement some energy saving measures (see point 2), it shouldn’t be noticeable. Power plant on your balcony Many of our Green PearlsⓇ partners generate their own electricity. Some accommodations, such as the newly opened OLM Nature Escape in South Tyrol, are completely energy self-sufficient. Many others generate at least a large percentage of their own power. Das Rübezahl, for example, a boutique hotel in southern Germany near Neuschwanstein Castle, has been generating about 90 percent of its electricity needs since 2021 with its own photovoltaic system and a combined heat and power plant. If you want to be an active part of the energy transition, but don’t have the opportunity to install a full rooftop solar system or geothermal probes right now, you could consider a balcony power plant. This is particularly worthwhile if you have a south-facing balcony. A Balcony Power Plant is a small, plug-and-play solar system that allows you to generate up to 600 watts of electricity (soon to be 800 watts) without the need for permits or bureaucratic hurdles. #2: Power consumption You can reduce power consumption in every area of your home. This not only conserves resources, but also saves you money. Electricity is often used unnecessarily anyway due to standby functions, etc. These are the top 10 energy wasters in the home, according to EON: Although televisions and wireless LANs are at the bottom of the list, it’s estimated that our entertainment devices consume about one-third of all electricity! So it reallly pays to use energy efficient devices. Sleep without “electrosmog “ All electrical devices (including household appliances, telephones, etc.) emit a certain amount of radiation. It is not really “smog”, which is a very high level of pollution in the air, but is commonly referred to as “electrosmog”. Even though radiation from household appliances is scientifically considered harmless to health, some people are concerned about the effects. In the Green Spirit hotels in Paris, there are rooms that use an alternative technology to shield their rooms specifically against electrosmog. If you too want to sleep “without radiation”, simply remove your cell phone from the bedroom at night and unplug other electrical devices. #3: Heating In order to save on heating costs, you can install smart heating thermostats on your radiators. The Naturhotel Outside in the Hohe Tauern Alpine National Park in East Tyrol, for example, recently made the switch. By optimizing heating curves, the hotel expects to save about 25 percent of its heating energy – without sacrificing warm rooms for guests. #4: Light Switching to LED bulbs is another way to make your home more sustainable. Unlike other bulbs, LED bulbs do not contain mercury. They also glow at full brightness when turned on and are extremely durable. Many hotels, such as the Biohotel Bella Vista Zermatt, have long used LEDs in combination with timers and motion detectors and thus save a lot of energy. And of course, remember to always turn the lights off when you leave the room 🙂 #5 Repair, renovate and restore Renovating or restoring old buildings and furniture saves plenty of resources and contributes to significantly lower CO2 emissions than constantly buying and building new things. Best of all, old materials tell countless stories, decades and sometimes centuries old, creating an exceptional atmosphere. One such example is the Hotel Klosterbräu in Seefeld, Tyrol. The hotel was built on 500-year-old monastery walls and has been family owned for 200 years. The Seyrling family has skillfully highlighted the old walls through careful renovations. Purchasing new furniture is often cheaper than keeping old furniture. However, you won’t get the same quality, and cheap pressed furniture can emit harmful substances like formaldehyde. In my own experience, the cost of an upholsterer to restore an old couch is more than the price of a new one. But eventually, we were able to choose the exact fabric we wanted, the couch already fit perfectly in the corner, and he even made matching pillowcases and a throw for us. In the end, we supported local crafts and did something for sustainability. The Gut Sonnenhausen eco-hotel near Munich is home to beautiful old, restored 18th-century farm cupboards. Tip: For some great upcycling ideas for your home, check out this blog post on upcycling inspiration. #6 Natural Materials Being surrounded by furnishing made of natural materials simply makes you feel more comfortable. The local Swiss stone pine wood, for example, is said to have a calming and sleep-inducing effect, which you can learn more about in our blog post on Swiss stone pine wood. At the Lifestylehotel SAND on the Timmendorfer Strand, you’ll sleep especially well on natural beds from Coco-Mat, which are hand-made in Greece using renewable raw materials such as cotton, algae, wool and wood. In general, more and more hotels are starting to build entire hotel rooms from natural materials that are fully compostable or recyclable, in line with the principles of the circular economy.\xa0 The SCHWARZWALD PANORAMA recently received an award for its “Circular Living” hotel room concept. It won third place in the German Tourism Award and was also one of the three finalists for the “German Corporate Sustainability Award.” #7 Saving water Most of us don’t want to do without the warm shower – especially in winter. Thereby we accept that we use huge quantities of water just to enjoy it on our skin one minute longer. That is why the Hotel Luise relies on the showers by Orbital Systems, which the Swedish enterprise originally developed for NASA. Meanwhile, these showers are not only to be found in the Hotel Luise, but you can also buy them for your home. Due to a special technology the water is purified in a closed loop and continually reused while you are showering. Thereby you do not only save 90 % of water and energy, but you can also take your shower with a clear conscience. #8 Clean – without chemicals! Many of our partner hotels, like the HUBERTUS Mountain Refugio Allgäu or the Hotel Weihrerhof in South Tyrol, rely on Miro steam cleaners or micro dry steam cleaners. According to the Hotel Weihrerhof, they can also be used to clean upholstered furniture and curtains. Advantages of micro-steam cleaning: Steam cleaners are also available for home use. While smaller in size, they are a promising option for environmentally friendly cleaning. The list of natural cleaning products in supermarkets and drugstores is growing, making it easy for even the average consumer to do without dry cleaning. Most cleaning jobs can be done with just a few household products, such as vinegar essence, baking soda, soda, and citric acid. #9 Zero-Waste kitchen A large part of our daily waste is produced in the kitchen due to the packaging of pre-prepared food as well as fresh ingredients. On the weekly markets in your city you can usually buy regional and above all seasonal ingredients without plastic packaging that you can directly put into your shopping bag. There is also a lot of food that you can grow at home. Just keep in mind: where there is a will there is way. For example, the Gili Lankanfushi on the Maldives managed to create an organic garden by means of a special composting system: that way, potatoes, carrots and much more grow in a place where before there has only been sand. So, if you do not have a garden, you can be creative in your kitchen using vertical indoor wall gardens, flower boxes for your windowsill or simply a few herbs in a pot. #10 Become a little more vegan Now that we’ve considered zero-waste, electricity and water consumption, let’s take a look at what we eat. It is a well-known fact that animal products in particular cause a lot of climate-damaging greenhouse gases. One alternative is to opt for a vegan diet. The LA VIMEA Hotel in South Tyrol is the first purely vegan hotel in Italy – you won’t find any animal products here. Other hotels are less radical but have added vegan alternatives to their menus and breakfast buffets. How about homemade hummus for a change, or vegan chocolate brownies? Both recipes stem from Hotel Paradiso Pure.Living on the Alpe di Siusi, which caters to vegans and vegetarians. Did we forget anything? Most certainly! Please let us know in the comments what other tips you might have for going green at home. Did you like this article? Share it!', 'Want to go on vacation and leave a smaller carbon footprint? Great! Many sustainable hotels and vacation rentals will help you get to your destination by eco-friendly train – for example, with a first-class upgrade or a free electric shuttle to the nearest train station. In this article, we show you the different incentives and support options available through Green Pearls® partner accommodations. Extra tip: Book directly with the hotel and get help with your arrival First, a general tip for green and fair travel: Book your accommodations directly through the hotel’s website. It’s no secret that travel sites like Booking.com take a commission from hotels when you book through them. So while you pay the same room rate, the hotels get less of it. The sustainable accommodations featured in this article are all personally and individually managed and you can contact them directly – you will find links to their websites on the Green PearlsⓇ microsites that we link to here. Our tip for traveling by train: Contact the hotel or vacation rental before you book (by email or phone). Tell them you are booking directly with them, that you are coming by train, and ask if there is anything they can do to help you travel green. Often there are special offers, such as a day of free e-bike use, or you can “beat” a free shuttle ☺️ Especially if you are staying longer, a sustainable accommodation will often meet you halfway. How sustainable accommodations reward and support you when you travel by train Upgrade to first class for the train ride to Zermatt Car-free Zermatt in Switzerland is the perfect destination for a vacation close to nature by train. The Visp-Zermatt line is considered to be a particularly picturesque route through the Swiss picture-book countryside ( like a route of these routes that you can watch on YouTube to relax). The boutique hotel, with a small spa and views of the Matterhorn, is run by the Anthamatten family and is committed to sustainability in all areas (e.g. zero waste principles and regional organic products). Free public transportation pass or guest card Another great offer from eco-friendly hotels are free local transportation passes – so you can get around in a climate-friendly way during your stay. Eco-friendly accommodation and transportation in Freiburg The Green City Hotel Vauban in the beautiful German city of Freiburg im Breisgau is an example of this. The modern city hotel with its green facade is easily accessible by train. Take the train to Freiburg’s main station and from there the number 3 tram to Paula-Modersohn-Platz – the stop is right in front of the hotel. Green PearlsⓇ hotels on the Ritten in South Tyrol offer you the RittenCard The Ritten Plateau in South Tyrol is a popular destination for an active vacation in the Italian Alps. You won’t need a car here, as the entire region is exemplary in its commitment to environmentally friendly transportation. The RittenCard gives you free use of all local transport, including the historic mountain railway and the cable car to Bolzano, as well as free entry to some 90 museums, exhibitions and attractions. “Thanks to our Green Mobility service, the car is a distant memory,” reports the ADLER Lodge RITTEN*. Here you also receive a RittenCard, as well as the possibility to rent e-bikes and hire experienced guides to accompany you on hikes or e-bike tours. Arrival: From the Bolzano train station it is a 5 minute walk to the Renon cable car. The cable car leaves every 4 minutes and takes you to Soprabolzano in 12 minutes. Once there, a shuttle from ADLER Lodge RITTEN will be waiting for you. The RittenCard is also included in the room price at the APIPURA hotel rinner and will be sent to you before you arrive. You can also reach the hotel from Bolzano with the Ritten cable car and from Oberbozen with the Ritten train – the “Rinner” stop is right in front of the hotel! If you are a bee lover, you will love the APIPURA hotel rinner: the hotel has its own organic apiary, there is a bee nature trail and organic honey is served daily at the breakfast buffet. Eco-friendly hiking vacation in the Hohe Tauern National Park with a guest card East Tyrol also has a guest card that allows you to use public transportation and offers free or a discount at many attractions. You receive one as a guest at the family-run Naturhotel Outside in Matrei. The hotel is an official hiking hotel with a hiking concierge and also offers a free shuttle from Lienz train station (there and back). A shuttle from Kitzbühel train station is available for a fee. Complimentary e-Shuttle service powered by green electricity If you travel by train, you are already traveling in a pretty environmentally friendly way. Now imagine being picked up at the station by an e-shuttle powered by the hotel’s green electricity – pretty green and convenient, isn’t it? This is possible at the Hotel Das Rübezahl in Füssen (the train station is also located here). And once you are there, the best way to explore the picturesque Allgäu region with its panoramic view of Neuschwanstein Castle is on foot. Hiking concierge Bergbaschdi will be happy to assist you. The Birkenhof***** Spa & Genussresort Hotel in the Upper Palatinate Lake District will pick you up at Schwandorf train station with its own electric shuttle. The hotel includes a large spa area with several saunas and pools, as well as the 2-star restaurant Obendorfers Eisvogel – you’ll find it hard to find a reason to leave the premises 🙂 At the Hotel Klosterbräu in Tyrol, you can order the hotel’s “Green Shuttle” (an electric Viano bus) for free throughout the Seefeld area. The Seefeld ICE train station is only 200 meters from the hotel, so you can easily walk there. However, the shuttle is worthwhile if you have heavy or bulky luggage, such as ski equipment or the like. The sustainable hotel complex within the old monastery walls offers a wide range of services, including wellness, its own brewery, yoga classes, a petting zoo and child care. “The electric vehicle is a highlight for our guests,” reports the CERVO Mountain Resort in Zermatt. As mentioned above, the village of Zermatt is car-free, and apart from the electric vehicles, only horse-drawn carriages are allowed. The CERVO consists of several wooden chalets and has an award-winning design style. Rail and Hotel: More eco-friendly hotels with shuttle services in Europe To stay within the scope of this article, we will give you a brief overview of even more sustainable European hotels with shuttle services: Germany Austria Italy Eco-hotels in Paris and Milan Of course, city hotels in European metropolises are ideal for combining train and eco-hotel. “Paris has 6 train stations, and depending on which direction guests are coming from, they arrive at the appropriate station. From Germany, it is Gare de L’Est and Gare du Nord,” says Barbara Tascijevic-Porwoll of the Green Spirit Hotels. The Amelie, Malar and Le Pavilion hotels are all in the 7th arrondissement, within walking distance of the Eiffel Tower. By the way, Paris has done a lot to become more bike-friendly and has created many new bike paths! Of course, there is also the famous metro, which is an environmentally friendly way to get from A to B. The marbled Milan Central Station is also accessible from all over Europe with direct lines. Here, in the heart of the city, lies the Hotel Milano Scala, Italy’s first zero-emissions hotel. All electricity is generated by geothermal probes. From the train station to the hotel by bus, bike, or on foot For our more rural partners, traveling by train is not quite as easy – but no less appealing for it. “We recommend that you take your bike with you when you arrive by train. And then cycle the rest of the way from Eystrup or Nienburg station to us,” explain the host sisters at Hotel Okelmann’s in Warpe. The train stations are about 20 kilometers away and can be reached from Bremen or Hannover. There is also a lot to discover in the area by bike. The Okelmanns’ father is an enthusiastic cyclist himself and has entered several routes in komoot. The Gut Guntrams in Austria can be reached from Vienna’s Pitten train station. From there, it is a 25-minute walk along a forest nature trail to Guntramsburg. The hotel’s website offers a beautifully designed map of the trail, complete with photos and arrows. First by train, then by bus The Pfunds in Tirol bus stop is just one minute from the Summit Lodges Pfunds, so you can catch the bus right outside your vacation home. The spacious log cabin has its own sauna and fireplace! During the winter there is also a ski bus to the ski area. The nearest train station is Landeck-Zams. To get to the Naturresort Gerbehof by train, you must first get to the train station in Friedrichshafen on Lake Constance. The station is 5 kilometers from the resort and there are buses to Ailingen every 15 minutes. The walk from Ailingen bus station to Gerbehof is 1.2 kilometers. A little exercise in nature never hurts anyone, as they say! Alternatively, you can always take a taxi from the station to your accommodation. Either way, you are traveling in a climate-friendly way and keeping your carbon footprint small. Both by traveling and by choosing your accommodation. You may even find that you enjoy traveling by public transportation or bicycle and use them more at home. *CIN-Codes: IT021011A1AE4737IT (My Arbor), IT008010A1NIWKHTTF (Relais del Maro), IT021072A1L46PNBHX (Hotel Weihrerhof), IT021072A1UOWUIDH4 (APIPURA hotel rinner), IT021072A1QCJQTLUQ (ADLER Lodge RITTEN) Save the article for your next travel plans and arrival by train.']","{'qa_similarity': 0.8453944325447083, 'context_relevance': 0.7673038244247437, 'answer_length': 303, 'has_structure': False}"

2025-01-25T22:09:45.913859,How do you choose sustainable accommodations?,"Choosing sustainable accommodations can be done by considering the following points:

1. Economic Impact: Opt for hotels that are sustainable and socially aware. These are establishments that ensure fair labor practices and use your money to benefit the local community and workers rather than multinational corporations. Examples include Green City Hotel Vauban and Farmhouse Smiling Gecko.

2. Resource Conservation: Choose accommodations that utilize renewable energy like geothermal or solar, and work towards reducing consumption of finite resources. Hotel Milano Scala is an example of a hotel that runs on renewable energy.

3. Upcycled and Organic: Opt for hotels that conserve resources by upcycling their buildings and furnishings, like the HUBERTUS Mountain Refugio Allgäu. It’s also a bonus if they employ organic and local food sourcing.

4. Promote Nature and Species Conservation: Select hotels that conserve and protect biodiversity. Casa León Royal Retreat, for instance, maintains a garden of native plants and uses only natural pest control.

5. Be a Part of the Community: Sustainable travel can also mean staying in places away from the usual tourism spots and interacting with locals. The Albergo Diffuso movement in Italy has revived Italian villages and enabled tourists to dwell among the locals.

6. Power Supply: Choose accommodations that use green power supplies; many establishments are now providing their own electricity through renewable sources.

In addition to these, you can look for certifications like Green PearlsⓇ or other recognized sustainability standards to support your choices.","['On our blog we often talk about HOW to travel sustainable. Today, though, we want to talk about WHY it is important. We’ll give away this much: it’s not just about protecting the environment. Ultimately, sustainable travel benefits you personally. #1 Tourism as an economic factor The tourism industry is an important economic factor – in some countries it is the most important. Your vacation sets your money in motion, helping to redistribute wealth and pay workers. Hotels are often large businesses with many employees, subcontractors, suppliers, etc. who also benefit from a financially successful hotel. Unfortunately, not all hotels are sustainable and socially responsible, and often your money does not benefit your vacation destination at all. You may travel to a hotel in Thailand and your money ends up with an investor in the US or Japan. Some hotels employ seasonal workers who live in shabby accommodations (I was told this for a German island, for example). By consciously choosing a hotel that operates in a sustainable and usually fair manner, you ensure that your money really benefits the region and creates fair jobs. Support fair labor practices in hotels One example is the Green City Hotel Vauban in Freiburg, Germany. This sustainable city hotel is an integration project, and half of all employees are people with physical and/or mental disabilities. The hotel has deep roots in Freiburg. Its shareholders are the Vereinigung Freiburger Sozialarbeit e.V. and the Freiburger Stadtbau GmbH. Even abroad, you have many opportunities to use your purchasing power to help other people (instead of supporting their exploitation). At our Green PearlsⓇ partner Farmhouse Smiling Gecko in Cambodia, the luxury resort ensures the financing of the Smiling Gecko NGO’s training centers, school and organic farm, and also serves as a training center and employer itself. #2 preserving resources You probably already know this: Planet B does not exist. The idea that we could someday completely deplete our planet of all its resources, destroy all animal and plant species (and perhaps even entire populations), and live on Mars from then on is NOT realistic! Fossil resources such as oil, coal and natural gas are finite. This means that they are taken from the Earth and then they are gone. Theoretically, these resources will eventually reform, but in the case of oil, for example, it takes at least 10,000 years for new oil to form from dead plant matter and plankton. We should all be aware that what we consume today will not be available to our children, grandchildren, great-grandchildren and future generations. Renewable energy in the hospitality industry In our opinion, one of the requirements for a sustainable hotel is to run on renewable energy. The least you can do is get 100% green electricity (something you can easily do at home by simply switching your electricity provider). But many hotels go further. For example, our partner Hotel Milano Scala was the first Zero Emission Hotel in Italy. It is powered by geothermal energy, a renewable energy source that “significantly reduces greenhouse gas emissions,” according to the Ministry of the Environment, Climate and Energy. Other hotels and residences rely on their own combined heat and power plants, heat pump technologies, photovoltaic and solar thermal systems, and heat recovery measures to reduce their own consumption of fossil resources while minimizing CO2 emissions. Upcycling and organic Conserving resources is not only about energy, but also about buildings and furnishings. The HUBERTUS Mountain Refugio Allgäu recently renovated its hotel rooms using a sustainable upcycling concept. Instead of buying new furniture, the existing solid wood furniture in the rooms was simply dismantled, the (outdated) decorations removed and the furniture reworked. The new composition created modern furniture without cutting down any trees! (You can learn more about this in this YouTube video by owner Marc Traubel and interior designer Sarah Stapelfeld) Throughout Biohotel Grafenast you will find sustainable and natural materials such as solid wood and local stone. The eco-friendly hotel is also committed to organic farming and uses only organic food – whenever possible, directly from the region and from the hotel’s own “Sehnsuchtsgarten” (garden of longing). Short delivery distances mean fewer greenhouse gases, and the absence of pesticides helps preserve biodiversity. #3 Promote nature and species conservation Which brings us to the next argument: sustainable travel supports conservation. Take, for example, the Casa León Royal Retreat in Gran Canaria. This small boutique hotel in the interior of the island has created a garden of native plants on its 10,000-square-meter property and uses only natural pest control. Here you can see a variety of small animals, such as the Canary Island bullfinch – the original form of the domesticated canary! The hotel uses a rainwater cistern system for irrigation. In another sustainable initiative, the family that owns Casa León Royal Retreat has leased a 40,000-square-foot piece of forest in the Balkans that is maintained but still largely untouched. This has created another protected area for animals and plants in this world, which also helps the climate. #4 Experience the country and its people in an authentic way Sustainable travel means going off the beaten track and visiting places away from the usual mass tourism destinations. This gives you a real opportunity to experience the country you are visiting and get to know the locals. Albergi Diffusi is saving villages in Italy In Italy, the Albergo Diffuso movement has helped save Italian villages from decay. An Albergo Diffuso is a hotel spread over several buildings in a village. You live among the locals. Our Green PearlsⓇ partner Relais del Maro is a prime example. Owner Elena Scalambrin converted several of her family’s commercial and residential buildings into a 4-star hotel. Guests arrive at the main house with a reception for dinner (and the pool), but otherwise stay in lovingly decorated rooms in the middle of the village community. The hotel has helped keep the village bakery and other local businesses alive. Here you will be able to experience the real Liguria and see the positive effects of sustainable tourism at first hand. #5 Learning to love nature “In the end, we will conserve only what we love” – Baba Dioum, Senegalese forestry engineer and conservationist It is easy to understand Baba Dioum’s famous quote, delivered at a biodiversity conference in India in 1968. As we showed in our blog post on insect extinction, many animals and plants simply do not have a strong “lobby”. We think of some bugs and algae as expendable. It is only when we understand the important role they play that we learn to love them and work to conserve them. Guided hikes in the Allgäu At Hotel Das Rübezahl in Füssen, you have the opportunity to discover nature with the hotel’s own hiking guide. “Bergbaschdi” will take you into the mountains and show you the flora and fauna. You are sure to discover things you would otherwise have missed. (Read more in our interview with the hiking concierge) Experience glaciers live in Switzerland Glaciers are also very interesting. These “eternal” masses of ice are the largest reservoirs of fresh water on our planet, and they are in danger of disappearing! Fabienne Anthamatten of the Hotel Bella Vista Zermatt can tell you all about it. Her hotel has an 8,000-year-old larch tree that she found on a former glacier field. This means that the trunk was preserved in the ice for several thousand years and has now been uncovered. On a trip to the glaciers, you can admire the fascinating masses of ice (there are still many kilometers left) and better understand the connections to global warming. #6 Have a vision – and think about the future Just being in the present moment is a beautiful mindfulness exercise. But you should also have a vision in your life. A vision is a motivating, positive idea about the future. And that’s what sustainable travel is all about. According to the UN, sustainable tourism is: “Tourism that takes full account of its current and future economic, social and environmental impacts.” So it’s thinking about the NOW as well as the FUTURE and taking responsibility for it. If you can do that, you’re doing pretty well. And what better way to learn how to do that and develop your own vision of the future than to travel the world sustainably and be inspired by other visionaries? If that’s not a good argument for sustainable travel, I don’t know what is? Save this article to Pinterest and share it with your friends! Not just for the environment!” width=”200″ height=”300″ data-kale-share-title=”6 reasons on why you should travel sustainably” data-kale-share-url=”https://green-travel-blog.com/6-reasons-on-why-you-should-travel-sustainable/”>', 'This is an update from our sustainable-home-article from November 30, 2017 Can’t it be more sustainable? A question many of our Green PearlsⓇ partners ask themselves all the time. As a result, hotels and resorts have implemented a variety of measures to reduce electricity, water and heating costs, as well as waste and CO₂ emissions. Many of these measures can also be implemented at home! The beauty is that it often only takes one step to live greener for many years to come. Going green – Planning and implementation Living sustainably involves so many things… Do you sometimes feel like you are inconsistent, getting bogged down, and maybe paying too much attention to the wrong things? You’re not alone! And rest assured, it’s almost impossible to be perfect in all aspects. But from time to time, it’s worth taking a look at your own behavior and identifying where you can improve. To that end, let’s take a look at a few areas of the home to see what improvements can be made and which ones will have the biggest impact. 10 tips for a more sustainable home #1: Power supply Before we look at the biggest power consumers in your home, you can start by looking at the sources from which you draw electricity. One of the easiest tips: Switch to green power! Switching to a new power provider is easy – particularly since it’s part of the provider’s service to help you do so. When making the switch, make sure it is truly green electricity, 100% renewable and not nuclear or coal-fired. You can find comparisons of green power providers in your area on the internet. You will also find the electricity tariffs there – green electricity is usually a bit more expensive, but if you implement some energy saving measures (see point 2), it shouldn’t be noticeable. Power plant on your balcony Many of our Green PearlsⓇ partners generate their own electricity. Some accommodations, such as the newly opened OLM Nature Escape in South Tyrol, are completely energy self-sufficient. Many others generate at least a large percentage of their own power. Das Rübezahl, for example, a boutique hotel in southern Germany near Neuschwanstein Castle, has been generating about 90 percent of its electricity needs since 2021 with its own photovoltaic system and a combined heat and power plant. If you want to be an active part of the energy transition, but don’t have the opportunity to install a full rooftop solar system or geothermal probes right now, you could consider a balcony power plant. This is particularly worthwhile if you have a south-facing balcony. A Balcony Power Plant is a small, plug-and-play solar system that allows you to generate up to 600 watts of electricity (soon to be 800 watts) without the need for permits or bureaucratic hurdles. #2: Power consumption You can reduce power consumption in every area of your home. This not only conserves resources, but also saves you money. Electricity is often used unnecessarily anyway due to standby functions, etc. These are the top 10 energy wasters in the home, according to EON: Although televisions and wireless LANs are at the bottom of the list, it’s estimated that our entertainment devices consume about one-third of all electricity! So it reallly pays to use energy efficient devices. Sleep without “electrosmog “ All electrical devices (including household appliances, telephones, etc.) emit a certain amount of radiation. It is not really “smog”, which is a very high level of pollution in the air, but is commonly referred to as “electrosmog”. Even though radiation from household appliances is scientifically considered harmless to health, some people are concerned about the effects. In the Green Spirit hotels in Paris, there are rooms that use an alternative technology to shield their rooms specifically against electrosmog. If you too want to sleep “without radiation”, simply remove your cell phone from the bedroom at night and unplug other electrical devices. #3: Heating In order to save on heating costs, you can install smart heating thermostats on your radiators. The Naturhotel Outside in the Hohe Tauern Alpine National Park in East Tyrol, for example, recently made the switch. By optimizing heating curves, the hotel expects to save about 25 percent of its heating energy – without sacrificing warm rooms for guests. #4: Light Switching to LED bulbs is another way to make your home more sustainable. Unlike other bulbs, LED bulbs do not contain mercury. They also glow at full brightness when turned on and are extremely durable. Many hotels, such as the Biohotel Bella Vista Zermatt, have long used LEDs in combination with timers and motion detectors and thus save a lot of energy. And of course, remember to always turn the lights off when you leave the room 🙂 #5 Repair, renovate and restore Renovating or restoring old buildings and furniture saves plenty of resources and contributes to significantly lower CO2 emissions than constantly buying and building new things. Best of all, old materials tell countless stories, decades and sometimes centuries old, creating an exceptional atmosphere. One such example is the Hotel Klosterbräu in Seefeld, Tyrol. The hotel was built on 500-year-old monastery walls and has been family owned for 200 years. The Seyrling family has skillfully highlighted the old walls through careful renovations. Purchasing new furniture is often cheaper than keeping old furniture. However, you won’t get the same quality, and cheap pressed furniture can emit harmful substances like formaldehyde. In my own experience, the cost of an upholsterer to restore an old couch is more than the price of a new one. But eventually, we were able to choose the exact fabric we wanted, the couch already fit perfectly in the corner, and he even made matching pillowcases and a throw for us. In the end, we supported local crafts and did something for sustainability. The Gut Sonnenhausen eco-hotel near Munich is home to beautiful old, restored 18th-century farm cupboards. Tip: For some great upcycling ideas for your home, check out this blog post on upcycling inspiration. #6 Natural Materials Being surrounded by furnishing made of natural materials simply makes you feel more comfortable. The local Swiss stone pine wood, for example, is said to have a calming and sleep-inducing effect, which you can learn more about in our blog post on Swiss stone pine wood. At the Lifestylehotel SAND on the Timmendorfer Strand, you’ll sleep especially well on natural beds from Coco-Mat, which are hand-made in Greece using renewable raw materials such as cotton, algae, wool and wood. In general, more and more hotels are starting to build entire hotel rooms from natural materials that are fully compostable or recyclable, in line with the principles of the circular economy.\xa0 The SCHWARZWALD PANORAMA recently received an award for its “Circular Living” hotel room concept. It won third place in the German Tourism Award and was also one of the three finalists for the “German Corporate Sustainability Award.” #7 Saving water Most of us don’t want to do without the warm shower – especially in winter. Thereby we accept that we use huge quantities of water just to enjoy it on our skin one minute longer. That is why the Hotel Luise relies on the showers by Orbital Systems, which the Swedish enterprise originally developed for NASA. Meanwhile, these showers are not only to be found in the Hotel Luise, but you can also buy them for your home. Due to a special technology the water is purified in a closed loop and continually reused while you are showering. Thereby you do not only save 90 % of water and energy, but you can also take your shower with a clear conscience. #8 Clean – without chemicals! Many of our partner hotels, like the HUBERTUS Mountain Refugio Allgäu or the Hotel Weihrerhof in South Tyrol, rely on Miro steam cleaners or micro dry steam cleaners. According to the Hotel Weihrerhof, they can also be used to clean upholstered furniture and curtains. Advantages of micro-steam cleaning: Steam cleaners are also available for home use. While smaller in size, they are a promising option for environmentally friendly cleaning. The list of natural cleaning products in supermarkets and drugstores is growing, making it easy for even the average consumer to do without dry cleaning. Most cleaning jobs can be done with just a few household products, such as vinegar essence, baking soda, soda, and citric acid. #9 Zero-Waste kitchen A large part of our daily waste is produced in the kitchen due to the packaging of pre-prepared food as well as fresh ingredients. On the weekly markets in your city you can usually buy regional and above all seasonal ingredients without plastic packaging that you can directly put into your shopping bag. There is also a lot of food that you can grow at home. Just keep in mind: where there is a will there is way. For example, the Gili Lankanfushi on the Maldives managed to create an organic garden by means of a special composting system: that way, potatoes, carrots and much more grow in a place where before there has only been sand. So, if you do not have a garden, you can be creative in your kitchen using vertical indoor wall gardens, flower boxes for your windowsill or simply a few herbs in a pot. #10 Become a little more vegan Now that we’ve considered zero-waste, electricity and water consumption, let’s take a look at what we eat. It is a well-known fact that animal products in particular cause a lot of climate-damaging greenhouse gases. One alternative is to opt for a vegan diet. The LA VIMEA Hotel in South Tyrol is the first purely vegan hotel in Italy – you won’t find any animal products here. Other hotels are less radical but have added vegan alternatives to their menus and breakfast buffets. How about homemade hummus for a change, or vegan chocolate brownies? Both recipes stem from Hotel Paradiso Pure.Living on the Alpe di Siusi, which caters to vegans and vegetarians. Did we forget anything? Most certainly!

Extra tip: Book directly with the hotel and get help with your arrival First, a general tip for green and fair travel: Book your accommodations directly through the hotel’s website.

Often there are special offers, such as a day of free e-bike use, or you can “beat” a free shuttle ☺️ Especially if you are staying longer, a sustainable accommodation will often meet you halfway. How sustainable accommodations reward and support you when you travel by train Upgrade to first class for the train ride to Zermatt Car-free Zermatt in Switzerland is the perfect destination for a vacation close to nature by train. The Visp-Zermatt line is considered to be a particularly picturesque route through the Swiss picture-book countryside ( like a route of these routes that you can watch on YouTube to relax). The boutique hotel, with a small spa and views of the Matterhorn, is run by the Anthamatten family and is committed to sustainability in all areas (e.g. zero waste principles and regional organic products). Free public transportation pass or guest card Another great offer from eco-friendly hotels are free local transportation passes – so you can get around in a climate-friendly way during your stay. Eco-friendly accommodation and transportation in Freiburg The Green City Hotel Vauban in the beautiful German city of Freiburg im Breisgau is an example of this. The modern city hotel with its green facade is easily accessible by train. Take the train to Freiburg’s main station and from there the number 3 tram to Paula-Modersohn-Platz – the stop is right in front of the hotel. Green PearlsⓇ hotels on the Ritten in South Tyrol offer you the RittenCard The Ritten Plateau in South Tyrol is a popular destination for an active vacation in the Italian Alps. You won’t need a car here, as the entire region is exemplary in its commitment to environmentally friendly transportation. The RittenCard gives you free use of all local transport, including the historic mountain railway and the cable car to Bolzano, as well as free entry to some 90 museums, exhibitions and attractions. “Thanks to our Green Mobility service, the car is a distant memory,” reports the ADLER Lodge RITTEN*. Here you also receive a RittenCard, as well as the possibility to rent e-bikes and hire experienced guides to accompany you on hikes or e-bike tours. Arrival: From the Bolzano train station it is a 5 minute walk to the Renon cable car. The cable car leaves every 4 minutes and takes you to Soprabolzano in 12 minutes. Once there, a shuttle from ADLER Lodge RITTEN will be waiting for you. The RittenCard is also included in the room price at the APIPURA hotel rinner and will be sent to you before you arrive. You can also reach the hotel from Bolzano with the Ritten cable car and from Oberbozen with the Ritten train – the “Rinner” stop is right in front of the hotel! If you are a bee lover, you will love the APIPURA hotel rinner: the hotel has its own organic apiary, there is a bee nature trail and organic honey is served daily at the breakfast buffet. Eco-friendly hiking vacation in the Hohe Tauern National Park with a guest card East Tyrol also has a guest card that allows you to use public transportation and offers free or a discount at many attractions. You receive one as a guest at the family-run Naturhotel Outside in Matrei. The hotel is an official hiking hotel with a hiking concierge and also offers a free shuttle from Lienz train station (there and back). A shuttle from Kitzbühel train station is available for a fee. Complimentary e-Shuttle service powered by green electricity If you travel by train, you are already traveling in a pretty environmentally friendly way. Now imagine being picked up at the station by an e-shuttle powered by the hotel’s green electricity – pretty green and convenient, isn’t it? This is possible at the Hotel Das Rübezahl in Füssen (the train station is also located here). And once you are there, the best way to explore the picturesque Allgäu region with its panoramic view of Neuschwanstein Castle is on foot. Hiking concierge Bergbaschdi will be happy to assist you. The Birkenhof***** Spa & Genussresort Hotel in the Upper Palatinate Lake District will pick you up at Schwandorf train station with its own electric shuttle. The hotel includes a large spa area with several saunas and pools, as well as the 2-star restaurant Obendorfers Eisvogel – you’ll find it hard to find a reason to leave the premises 🙂 At the Hotel Klosterbräu in Tyrol, you can order the hotel’s “Green Shuttle” (an electric Viano bus) for free throughout the Seefeld area. The Seefeld ICE train station is only 200 meters from the hotel, so you can easily walk there. However, the shuttle is worthwhile if you have heavy or bulky luggage, such as ski equipment or the like. The sustainable hotel complex within the old monastery walls offers a wide range of services, including wellness, its own brewery, yoga classes, a petting zoo and child care. “The electric vehicle is a highlight for our guests,” reports the CERVO Mountain Resort in Zermatt. As mentioned above, the village of Zermatt is car-free, and apart from the electric vehicles, only horse-drawn carriages are allowed. The CERVO consists of several wooden chalets and has an award-winning design style. Rail and Hotel: More eco-friendly hotels with shuttle services in Europe To stay within the scope of this article, we will give you a brief overview of even more sustainable European hotels with shuttle services: Germany Austria Italy Eco-hotels in Paris and Milan Of course, city hotels in European metropolises are ideal for combining train and eco-hotel. “Paris has 6 train stations, and depending on which direction guests are coming from, they arrive at the appropriate station. From Germany, it is Gare de L’Est and Gare du Nord,” says Barbara Tascijevic-Porwoll of the Green Spirit Hotels. The Amelie, Malar and Le Pavilion hotels are all in the 7th arrondissement, within walking distance of the Eiffel Tower. By the way, Paris has done a lot to become more bike-friendly and has created many new bike paths! Of course, there is also the famous metro, which is an environmentally friendly way to get from A to B. The marbled Milan Central Station is also accessible from all over Europe with direct lines. Here, in the heart of the city, lies the Hotel Milano Scala, Italy’s first zero-emissions hotel. All electricity is generated by geothermal probes. From the train station to the hotel by bus, bike, or on foot For our more rural partners, traveling by train is not quite as easy – but no less appealing for it. “We recommend that you take your bike with you when you arrive by train. And then cycle the rest of the way from Eystrup or Nienburg station to us,” explain the host sisters at Hotel Okelmann’s in Warpe. The train stations are about 20 kilometers away and can be reached from Bremen or Hannover. There is also a lot to discover in the area by bike. The Okelmanns’ father is an enthusiastic cyclist himself and has entered several routes in komoot. The Gut Guntrams in Austria can be reached from Vienna’s Pitten train station. From there, it is a 25-minute walk along a forest nature trail to Guntramsburg. The hotel’s website offers a beautifully designed map of the trail, complete with photos and arrows. First by train, then by bus The Pfunds in Tirol bus stop is just one minute from the Summit Lodges Pfunds, so you can catch the bus right outside your vacation home. The spacious log cabin has its own sauna and fireplace! During the winter there is also a ski bus to the ski area. The nearest train station is Landeck-Zams. To get to the Naturresort Gerbehof by train, you must first get to the train station in Friedrichshafen on Lake Constance. The station is 5 kilometers from the resort and there are buses to Ailingen every 15 minutes. The walk from Ailingen bus station to Gerbehof is 1.2 kilometers. A little exercise in nature never hurts anyone, as they say! Alternatively, you can always take a taxi from the station to your accommodation. Either way, you are traveling in a climate-friendly way and keeping your carbon footprint small. Both by traveling and by choosing your accommodation. You may even find that you enjoy traveling by public transportation or bicycle and use them more at home. *CIN-Codes: IT021011A1AE4737IT (My Arbor), IT008010A1NIWKHTTF (Relais del Maro), IT021072A1L46PNBHX (Hotel Weihrerhof), IT021072A1UOWUIDH4 (APIPURA hotel rinner), IT021072A1QCJQTLUQ (ADLER Lodge RITTEN) Save the article for your next travel plans and arrival by train.']","{'qa_similarity': 0.6959887146949768, 'context_relevance': 0.7741075754165649, 'answer_length': 241, 'has_structure': False}"

2025-01-25T22:09:54.379867,How can tourists support local communities while traveling?,"Tourists can support local communities while traveling by engaging in sustainable tourism practices. These can include:

1. Buying locally made products: This can benefit the local economy by supporting local businesses and artisans.

2. Staying in locally owned accommodations: Hotels and guesthouses that are owned by locals tend to put more money back into the community compared to international chains.

3. Participating in community-led tourism initiatives: Such programs offer authentic local experiences, while the proceeds can support community development projects.

4. Respecting local customs and cultural practices: Tourists should educate themselves about local customs and traditions to show respect and avoid causing offense.

5. Minimizing environmental impact: Tourists should strive to leave no trace, by properly disposing of waste, avoiding single-use plastics, and conserving resources like water and energy wherever possible.

6. Advocating for fair wages and working conditions: Tourists can choose to support businesses that uphold fair wage and working conditions for their employees.

By adopting these sustainable travel practices, tourists can contribute to a more equitable form of tourism that benefits local communities.","['Implementing an island-wide resident survey to gauge community perceptions of tourism \n\n\n\nEmploying 1 in 10 people globally, tourism has the potential to benefit a large number of people. By creating jobs, driving infrastructure improvements, and promoting inclusive growth, tourism is a powerful tool to fight poverty and foster community development.With all these benefits, one might assume that local residents would be fully supportive of tourism in their backyards. The problem is that sometimes tourism development has the opposite effect and diminishes local quality of life. Without proper planning, tourism growth can bring about new challenges for locals, such as unaffordable housing prices, dwindling resources, and a loss of cultural authenticity. Over the last year, there’s been increasing global discussion around the issue of “overtourism” and its consequences in more popular destinations, where some communities are literally telling tourists to go home.How then does a destination prevent this situation from happening before it’s too late? It all comes down to finding the balance between tourism growth and local needs.To ensure that tourism enriches local communities, destination managers must pay attention to resident concerns and engage them in development plans. Happy residents play a major part in creating an enjoyable visitor experience and successful tourism industry. When residents win, everyone wins. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOur Role \n\n\n\nThe Caribbean island of St. Kitts is a destination that is well aware of the importance of sustainable, community-driven tourism.\xa0The warm and welcoming Kittitian people are undeniably the heart and soul of the island. The St. Kitts Ministry of Tourism is working to make sure that they are at the heart of tourism as well, by giving them a voice in development.To gauge local attitudes toward tourism, Sustainable Travel International supported the Ministry in administering a resident survey in 2017. This was the first survey of this kind in St. Kitts. Over 320 Kittitians, representing all parishes and demographics completed the survey. \xa0The results examine how well tourism in St. Kitts is meeting local needs, creating opportunities for residents, and impacting their quality of life. A follow-on survey was conducted in 2021 to analyze changes over time and identify opportunities where more can be done to adequately meet resident needs.Understanding resident concerns is the starting point. The next step is taking action to address any existing or potential issues. The Ministry is using the survey findings to guide policy and program interventions, making it a valuable tool for community development.Of course, as tourism grows and the destination changes, residents’ feelings and priorities will change as well. Engaging residents should be an ongoing process. We will continue to support the Ministry to create additional avenues for residents to share their opinions and be involved in decision-making, as well as implement future surveys to monitor changes over time.

The verdant locale has a birds-eye view of Mt. Agua, quaint coffee fincas, and shops filled with handmade goods. You will be won over by the kind-hearted residents. It has the kind of charming, unspoiled feel of the kind of place that would draw in Anthony Bourdain. Honest, natural, and teeming with life. Because of this, the rural village stands out as a model for community-based tourism. In fact, this October San Cristóbal El Alto hosted the 2018 Primer Encuentro Centroamericano de Turismo Comunitario (ECATC) conference. The event brought together community members and industry professionals from across Central America to create alliances, build strategy, and foster ideas to further sustainable tourism. The conference was pulsing with excitement as attendees brainstormed ways to conscientiously bridge the gap between travelers and burgeoning but fragile destinations. Since rural communities often have a high dependency on natural resources and place greater value on cultural traditions, exploring how tourism can sustain these territories is crucial. This is something Travolution, the organizers of ECATC, understand and work hard to promote. As a non-profit aimed at facilitating intercultural exchanges, Travolution organizes networking events such as ECATC and offers curated tours throughout South America. Their work highlights how indigenous tourism can transform the lives of the traveler and benefit the destination. To understand this better, one need only to look at the company’s “why” for how \xa0tourism can be an effective tool for sustainable development. They find that tourism, done right: Though they don’t yet offer tours in Guatemala, Travolution plans to bring their touring services there eventually. It’s easy to see why when you look at the initiatives under way in this marvelous country. The community of San Juan la Laguna How community-based tourism is shaping the country When people think of Guatemala, the first thing that comes to mind is often coffee. Although coffee farms and agriculture are a staple of the country’s economy, community-based tourism is a close contender. Rural villages and cities in Guatemala are bringing cultural identity to the foreground of the tourism experience as a way to bolster the economic landscape. Guatemala, deemed the heart of the Mayan world, has a lot of culture to offer. The diversity of the land can be seen in its 21 languages, flavorful food, magnificent arts, and astounding folklore. Indigenous tribes make up 51% of the population. Within each tribe, different symbols and patterns tell a story of their traditions and identity. This is primarily seen in rich art and textiles, and especially in weaving. It’s also how some communities in Guatemala are using their heritage to tell a new story- one of empowerment and sustainability. Woven into the fabric of life Many of the women in Guatemala still wear the traditional dress, traje- which consists of a skillfully woven huipil (blouse), skirt and sash. The pattern of the huipil indicates what region and tribe the clothing are from. Each handmade garment is intricate, colorful, and can take up to a year to create. A woman, wearing her traje, weaving at the Santo Domingo Xenacoj cooperative For many of the Maya, the clothing is more than just a way to identify their region. It holds ancestral significance and ties them directly to their lineage. Specific patterns on the garments can indicate stature in the community and some are reserved for sacred events and ceremonies. In many ways, the huipil is the common thread throughout the tourism experience. The combination of geometric patterns, colors, animal and plant symbols appear in many forms and serve as a bright reminder of the richness of the culture. A woman wearing a huipil and other Mayan symbols depicted on a street mural These cities are leading the way for sustainability in Guatemala San Juan la Laguna This lakeside town is a must for any responsible traveler visiting the Lake Atitlán region. The colorful town is a boon for those who want to experience and support locally run initiatives. Supported by Planeterra, a community-led organization, Rupalaj Kistalin offers cultural exchange tours that preserve the heritage, people, and environment. Because the village is remote, job opportunities are limited and the much of the community relies on these programs for financial support. Through Posadas Mayas, or homestay programs, visitors can get a first-hand experience of life in the hamlet of San Juan la Laguna. There are 26 Tz’utujil families that have opened their homes to guests. Each host family will take in new guests each week and share their home and food. While the homestay experience provides a unique window into everyday life for the Tz’utujil, Rupalaj Kistalin also offers tours that feature textiles, medicinal plants, painting, and chocolate. When you buy a gift at many of these cooperatives, a significant portion of your purchase goes toward community projects and education. A highlight of the tour is the Gloria Cholotio Art Gallery and the Ixoq Ajkeem weaving demonstration center, where you can learn about the process of using natural dyes. San Pedro la Laguna Seven out of 26 municipalities in Guatemala have or are starting to implement a single-use plastics ban. This includes straws, styrofoam and plastic sacks. San Pedro la Laguna was the first on Lake Atitlán to take the lead! In 2015 the local government passed an ordinance moving toward environmental conservation. The city saw how polluted the lake was becoming due to plastics and decided that in order to preserve the natural beauty of the lake and attract more tourism, they needed to do something about it. What wasn’t an easy shift at first has now become a standard. Local residents were initially uninterested in making the switch because they thought it would cost too much, but the government visited each family and gave them tools to make the switch to a plastic-free life. Now everyone carries reusable bags and Tupperware to the street market. Santa Catarina Polopó Painted houses in Santa Catalina Polopo Art is a tool for change in the city of Santa Catarina Polopó. Another city in the Solola region near Lake Atitlán, Santa Catarina Polopó is a fishing village. In recent years the population has increased significantly, which has shifted the economic landscape. Traditional trades like fishing and agriculture are no longer a viable option. Many of the Maya Kakchikel families are being forced into extreme poverty because they can’t keep up with commerce and don’t have the necessary skills for a competitive job market. That’s where Pintanado Santa Catarina Polopó comes in. Built for the community, the organization aims to revitalize the town by making it a cultural destination through art. With the support of community leaders and volunteers, individual homes are painted with Mayan symbols. The organization expects that this \xa0beautification will lead to more tourism and in turn, more investment opportunities, jobs, and publicity for indigenous arts. The project also allows families to reclaim their heritage through these symbols by giving them exposure. There are around 850 houses that are set to be painted by 2019. Each family chooses the base color, symbols, and secondary colors. The association then provides the painting materials and a locally-employed promoter, who ensures that the project is completed. The cherry on top? The paint is ecologically friendly! “The design starts from the idea that Santa Catarina is a large huipil that is drying on the mountain and that connects the lake with the sky of Atitlán.”- Pinatanado Santa Catarina Polopó El Paredón Surfing, sunshine, and sea turtles. El Paredón is a hidden gem on the Pacific coast of Guatemala. Still relatively unknown, the oceanside village is starting to gain tourism traction. This has caused some concern for the largely conservative population, who are deterred by the party hostels cropping up. However, the social enterprise La Choza Chula is working to ensure that the tourism boom doesn’t hurt the residents. The proceeds from Chula tours go towards funding education and environmental projects. They’ve set up a community garden and are teaching people how to grow their own food. They have also established a computer lab, a secondary school, and a library. This is extremely important when you consider that Guatemala has the lowest literacy rate in Latin America. La Choza Chula is also committed to providing jobs by hiring residents for guides and hosts. They offer homestays, turtle tours, cooking classes and more. El Paredon makes up 10% of all of Guatemala’s mangrove systems which are, unfortunately, being deforested. Because their biosystem is so fragile, the organization is working to change the local mentality and stress the importance of beach clean up and conservation. La Choza Chula in El Paredon The great news is that these examples are only a small taste of the Guatemalan movement towards sustainability. Companies like Guatepassport offer entire eco-friendly holidays, and even the Guatemalan tourism institute, INGUAT, is pushing for reform.

While the small size and remoteness of these destinations makes for ideal getaways, these characteristics also bring along many challenges. Visitors often put increased pressure on the already limited supply of agricultural products, water and energy. This results in a further dependence on imported goods and contributes to excess waste production. On top of these challenges, the transportation of imported goods drives up carbon emissions, exacerbating the climate change impacts to which small islands are particularly vulnerable.The Pacific islands also must cope with economic vulnerability due to their geographic isolation and small size. According to the Asian Development Bank, 31 percent of Fiji’s population and 26.9 percent of Samoa’s population lived below the poverty line in 2014. Tourism is a key driver of economic development in these destinations. The industry has the potential to combat poverty by providing more jobs, growing incomes, and creating markets for local goods and services. However, there is still an opportunity for the tourism sector in the Pacific to be more inclusive of local suppliers and service providers and prioritize capacity building. This will help ensure that local communities are truly reaping the economic benefits of the industry. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat We're Doing \n\n\n\nAt the United Nations Conference on Sustainable Development (Rio+20) in 2012, Heads of State adopted the\xa010-Year Framework of Programmes on Sustainable Consumption and Production Patterns (10YFP), a global framework for action to accelerate the shift towards SCP including resource efficient and low carbon tourism, in both developed and developing countries.\xa0In 2015, the\xa0Pacific Sustainable Tourism Alliance (PSTA)\xa0was formed as a public-private partnership with the South Pacific Tourism Organization (SPTO) to help fast track sustainability in the region. Sustainable Travel International working with the SPTO under the auspices of the PSTA, was\xa0awarded a grant through the 10YFP Trust Fund call for proposals for Sustainable Tourism Programme to implement a pilot project focused on improving sustainable resource management in hotels in the Pacific.The destinations participating in the preliminary stage of the project are Fiji and Samoa; however the eventual intention is to expand to other Pacific Islands.

2025-01-25T22:10:06.321111,What are the best practices for sustainable hiking and outdoor activities?,"The best practices for sustainable hiking and outdoor activities, based on the information provided, could include:

1. Choosing Sustainable Accommodations: Opt for ski-in, ski-out hotels that are committed to sustainability. These hotels allow you to start skiing right outside the hotel door, which saves you the shuttle ride, and lowers your carbon output. The Paradiso Pure.Living Vegan Hotel in South Tyrol, Italy, for example, focuses on the vegan lifestyle and gets 90% of its electricity from hydroelectricity; Hotel Bella Vista Zermatt in Switzerland has made substantial investments in sustainability; CERVO Mountain Resort Zermatt, also in Switzerland, and Biohotel Grafenast in Tyrol, Austria are all sustainable ski-in, ski-out hotels. 

2. Minimizing Carbon Footprint: Come up with a ""Plan B"" in case there is no snow during your trip. Hiking or a cultural program are good substitutions that minimize the need for activities that require heavy infrastructure or artificial snow, which have a larger environmental impact. 

3. Snowmaking: Be aware of the impact of artificial snowmaking. It requires a lot of water and energy, and its use is spreading. Choosing a snow-sure area for your vacation, typically in the Alpine region above 1,200 meters, could help avoid resorts that heavily rely on artificial snow.

4. Sustainable Travel: Consider reaching your destination by train, a more sustainable means of transport than cars or planes. Some hotels offer pickups from train stations, which saves you from having to take a taxi or other car service. For instance, you can reach the Paradiso Pure.Living Vegan Hotel, the CERVO Mountain Resort, and My Arbor in South Tyrol, Italy by train.

5. Local sourcing: Opt for accommodations and restaurants that source their food and beverages locally, and lean towards plant-based options. This reduces the carbon footprint associated with transporting food.

6. Avoid over-development: Support measures that preserve the natural environment, such as the halt to the development of new ski resorts, as demanded by the WWF.

In conclusion, these sustainable practices aim to minimize carbon output, limit environmental impact, and ensure future generations can also enjoy the beautiful outdoors.","['Skis on, out of the hotel and onto the slopes – a ski-in, ski-out hotel lets you start your day’s skiing right outside the hotel door, saving you the daily shuttle ride.

We’ll show you what else to look for and introduce you to six sustainable accommodations right on the slopes. 5 ways to make your ski vacation more sustainable Skiing vacations have been criticized from a sustainability perspective due to the extensive infrastructure required. That’s why we’d like to start by briefly summarizing how you can minimize your carbon footprint on a ski vacation: Ski-in, ski-out hotels with guaranteed snow In the face of climate change, we recommend preparing to compromise and having a “Plan B” in case there is no snow during your booked trip, such as winter hiking or a cultural program. Alternatively, consider staying at ski hotels located in “snow-sure” areas, typically in the Alpine region above 1,200 meters. Is artificial snow an environmental issue? According to Statista, about 90 percent of all ski slopes in Italy have snowmaking systems. In Austria the figure is 70%, in Switzerland 53% and in Germany only 25%. Attitudes toward artificial snow vary widely across the Alpine region. Ski resorts that use artificial snow, such as Dolomiti Superski, argue that artificial snow is “just water”. When forced out of a small hole under high pressure, the cold turns it into snow. This process does not involve any chemicals. Water typically comes from specially constructed reservoirs and returns to the ground as the snow melts. So there are no problems? According to the WWF, there are. Artificial snow requires millions of gallons of water, energy and noise. The absence of trees on the slopes and the compacted ground from grading prevent the snow from being absorbed quickly when it melts, increasing the risk of landslides. The WWF ultimately demands a halt to the development of new ski resorts. It also criticizes hotel complexes as “real energy eaters”. This makes choosing a sustainable ski hotel all the more important. Sustainable ski-in, ski-out hotels in South Tyrol, Tyrol and Switzerland Here are five ski hotels that are right on the slopes and committed to sustainability. As an added bonus, there’s also a vacation home in Tyrol that’s not right on the slopes – but the ski bus stops right outside. #1 Paradiso Pure.Living Vegan Hotel | South Tyrol | Italy The Paradiso Pure.Living Vegan Hotel is located at an altitude of 2,020 meters on the Seiser Alm in the Dolomites. Due to its proximity to the UNESCO World Heritage Site, the hotel feels a special commitment to nature. It is unique in the region in its commitment to the vegan lifestyle. Food and beverages are 100 percent vegan, and as much as possible is organic and locally sourced. For example, you will find many creations with organic South Tyrolean apples, but also vegan pizza for lunch, vegan brownies in the afternoon, dumplings, pasta, herbs and vegetables – a fantastically creative and climate-friendly plant-based cuisine that you should try, even if you are not vegan! In addition to its magnificent location on two ski slopes, the hotel offers a spa area with several saunas and an outdoor saltwater hot tub. The hotel also promotes contemporary art with rotating exhibitions. Furthermore, it uses green electricity from Alperia, which is 90 percent hydroelectric. Ski Resort: The Paradiso Pure.Living Vegan Hotel is located in the Seiser Alm ski resort with 32 ski runs. However, the Seiser Alm is only one of twelve interconnected ski resorts, all of which are part of the Dolomiti Superski area. This means that with one ski pass you have 1,200 kilometers of slopes at your disposal! (For comparison, 200 kilometers or more of slopes is what you call a “big ski area”). Fortunately, Dolomiti Superski is also committed to sustainability, as detailed here on their website. However, the resort does use artificial snow. According to them, natural snow would not last the entire season, so they have to use artificial one. Sustainable travel: You can reach the Seiser Alm by train. From there the hotel will pick you up with a snow shuttle at a meeting point. #2 Hotel Bella Vista Zermatt | Switzerland Hotel Bella Vista Zermatt is a small, family-run hotel with only 21 rooms. The hotel has a view of the Matterhorn and is located above the center of Zermatt on 1620m. The Anthamatten family has managed the establishment for three generations. Hostess Fabienne Anthamatten is dedicated to zero-waste practices and has a keen interest in old wood and glacier melt. Her husband, Simon, is a mountain guide and helicopter pilot. Fabienne’s sister, Stefanie, a trained yoga teacher, also welcomes guests at the reception. Meanwhile, “Mama” Bernadette delights visitors with her homemade soups and jams. The Swiss hotel is not only family friendly, but also very cozy – with a stone pine parlor and fireplace in the lobby, as well as a small spa area with saunas. Ski area: The hotel is located below the Sunnegga – Rothorn valley station – so the valley run takes you directly to your hotel. Here you are connected to the Rothorn, Gornergrat Glacier and the Matterhorn Paradise ski area, which also includes Zermatt. Matterhorn Paradise is the highest ski area in the Alps (almost 4,000 meters in some places) and the largest summer ski area in Europe. It is open year round as many of the slopes are on glaciers. There are 360 km of slopes and you can even ski to Italy. Zermatt’s cable cars have been investing in sustainability for several years and are TourCert certified. Despite its glacier location, the slopes are regularly covered with artificial snow. Sustainable travel: Zermatt is car-free and accessible by train – as an added bonus, the hotel will even upgrade you to 1st class on the Visp-Zermatt route (for stays of 3 nights or more). Your luggage can be transported separately. A complimentary Hotel Bella Vista shuttle will pick you up at the train station. #3 CERVO Mountain Resort Zermatt | Switzerland The CERVO Mountain Resort, also located in the Swiss ski resort of Zermatt on the Matterhorn, is an exceptional ski-in, ski-out hotel. The sustainable resort consists of several buildings, restaurants and a spa area, and CERVO’s terraces are a popular spot for après-ski. The program includes numerous social events with live music, a group moonlight ski decent, movie night with fondue, etc. So this is the perfect place for you if you want to meet new people and enjoy some entertainment during your ski vacation. Ski area: The resort in Zermatt is also part of the aforementioned Matterhorn Paradise. Sustainable travel: You can also reach CERVO Mountain Resort by train via Zermatt station. Your ski pass can be ordered prior to your arrival and picked up at the reception desk. #4 Biohotel Grafenast | Tirol | Österreich If you are looking for a ski-in-ski-out hotel for a family ski vacation, we recommend the Biohotel Grafenast in Tyrol. The hotel is run by the Unterlechner family. Grandfather “Rodel-Toni” built a toboggan hut on the Pillberg in 1907, which still exists today. Situated at an altitude of 1,330 meters, you have a wonderful view of the valley. With only 23 rooms (some of which are family rooms with separate children’s rooms), the atmosphere is intimate. Organic food, environmental protection and nature are very important to the Unterlechners, which is why they cook only with organic products. Ski area: Biohotel Grafenast is located just 150 meters from the Kellerjoch ski area. The base station of the Kellerjochbahn, which takes you up to 1,890 meters, is just a few steps away. The small ski area has 20 km of slopes and 7 downhill runs, making it perfect for a (first) ski vacation with children. According to Snowtrex, about 30 percent of the slopes are covered with artificial snow. By the way, Café Rodel-Toni is located right next to the children’s ski school. Here parents can take a break while the kids learn to ski or play in the Kinderland. Sustainable travel: The closest train stations are Jenbach and Schwaz. For stays of three nights or more, half the taxi fare to the Biohotel will be reimbursed. #5 My Arbor | Südtirol | Italien If you are traveling without children and prefer the tranquility of an adults-only hotel, My Arbor may be just what you are looking for. Located near Brixen, it is an architectural highlight built on stilts in the middle of a spruce forest. The wellness hotel is located directly on the Plose Mountain. „After breakfast, I go to the ski room, put on my ski boots, grab my skis, and head straight from My Arbor to the Plose base station.“ – Alexandra Huber, My Arbor Ski area: The Plose ski area is particularly sunny and with 7 lifts and about 40 km of slopes ranging in altitude from 1,067 to 2,446 meters, quite modest. Its highlight is South Tyrol’s longest downhill run: 9 km. Sustainable travel: Brixen train station has direct connections from many major cities in Italy, Germany and Austria. Guests staying at My Arbor for 7 nights or more are picked up at the station free of charge. Otherwise, a taxi will cost approximately 30 euros for a 15-minute ride. #6 Summit Lodges Pfunds | Tyrol | Austria Finally, we would like to introduce you to two vacation homes that are not ski-in-ski-out, but have a ski bus stop right outside the door. The Summit Lodges Pfunds are American log cabin-style vacation homes that sleep up to six people and have their own sauna and wood-burning fireplace. With their own kitchens, you will be able to cook for yourself and plan your winter vacation at your own pace. Ski area: There are six ski resorts in the area and the ski bus stops just steps away from the apartments. A 20 minute drive will take you to the Tyrolean ski resort Nauders, which has 75 kilometers of slopes between 1,400 and 2,750 meters. The resort is snow sure, but artificial snow is still in use. If you take the ski bus a little further, you can also reach the Italian region of South Tyrol in about 35 minutes. Here at the Reschen Pass, there are 65 kilometers of slopes and 15 ski lifts around the Reschen Lake. Due to the altitude of 1,500 to 2,400 meters, it is considered snow-sure as well, but snow machines are still employed. Artificial snowmaking will continue to spread As you can see, even resorts that advertise sustainability cannot avoid the use of artificial snow. Particularly alarming is the fact that in the United States, slopes are already snowed with the addition of bacteria, a practice banned in Germany and Austria. The bacteria ensure that snow is produced even at low temperatures. Environmentalists fear that this could have unprecedented effects on the environment. But with global warming, it could be an attractive option for more ski resorts. In the future, a ski-in, ski-out vacation will only be possible through sustainability Skiing is far less sustainable than more gentle winter sports such as snowshoeing. All the more reason to consider some sustainability issues when going on a ski vacation. Ski-in-ski-out hotels are located in the heart of the resort, so you can experience nature – and its preparation – firsthand. As wonderful as this is, it should also be possible for future generations.', 'Skis on, out of the hotel and onto the slopes – a ski-in, ski-out hotel lets you start your day’s skiing right outside the hotel door, saving you the daily shuttle ride. But that’s not all that makes your ski vacation sustainable. We’ll show you what else to look for and introduce you to six sustainable accommodations right on the slopes. 5 ways to make your ski vacation more sustainable Skiing vacations have been criticized from a sustainability perspective due to the extensive infrastructure required.

2025-01-25T22:10:16.351869,How to plan an eco-friendly vacation from start to finish?,"To plan an eco-friendly vacation from start to finish, follow these steps:

1. Determine your budget: Identify how much you can and want to spend. Prioritize what's important to you, such as accommodations or activities.

2. Plan your trip: Consider what type of vacation you want, such as a city visit, beach vacation, or nature experience. Opt for less touristy areas to counteract mass tourism and support smaller economies.

3. Choose your time to travel: If possible, avoid high seasons to save money and prevent overcrowding.

4. Transportation: Use public transport like trains or buses which are usually cheaper and more sustainable. If traveling by car, consider an electric one and plan to drive slower to save fuel.

5. Accommodation: Book in advance to get good deals on sustainable accommodations. Consider options like couchsurfing, housesitting, hostels or eco-conscious hotels.

6. Plan your experiences: Do your research to see which attractions you want to visit and book them in advance to avoid long lines and potentially get online discounts. 

7. Use green travel plans and policies: These provide a controlled approach to managing emissions that arise from travel, such as flights, accommodation, taxis, and commuting. 

Remember, sustainable travel doesn’t always mean you have to spend more, if planned well in advanced, it might even help you save money. Even when you're there, stay open to new experiences and try to interact with the locals to understand their culture and lifestyle.  

Note that reducing your carbon footprint for your journey is not just environmentally-friendly but also enhances your overall experience by improving morale and strengthening your image as a responsible traveler. It's beneficial to use hotels that reward green travel strategies, such as offering first-class upgrades for train travel or providing free electric shuttle services.
Remember to book accommodations directly through the hotel's website to ensure you're supporting sustainable business practices.

Always make sure to make sustainable choices wherever possible - this way, your travel will leave a smaller carbon footprint.","['You know what argument against sustainable travel is absolute nonsense? That traveling sustainably is always going to cost more. Yes, sustainable travel is sometimes more expensive, it requires us to do more research and work on ourselves. But spend more money? You don’t have to. In fact, you can actually save money by going sustainable! We’ll show you how! The most important rule for sustainable travel: Planning Yes, you read that right. If you’re traveling on a budget, or can’t or won’t go overspend, you need to plan and book a lot of things in advance. First and foremost, your transportation and accommodations. Sure, you can get lucky with last-minute bargains, but in most cases you will end up paying more elsewhere. For example: You book a dirt-cheap last-minute flight (never mind that flying is unsustainable!), but you have to pay a lot for your last-minute accommodations because there are hardly any options left, all the low-budget options are fully booked, or only the terrible accommodations are available. So remember: If you want to travel on a budget, book early! Spontaneous bookings are expensive! However, that doesn’t mean you have to plan your entire vacation in advance. It’s great to just go with the flow when you get there, talk to the locals, and then decide what you want to do! Tips for your budget When planning your low-budget trip, the first step is to determine your budget. How much can you spend? And how much do you want to spend? You should also be clear about what is important to you. For example, if a decent hotel is important to you, plan to spend a little more on that and a little less on activities that cost money. If certain (and expensive) experiences are more important to you, you may want to cut back on your accommodations. Either way, write your thoughts down! Believe us, it makes a difference to have your budget in black and white next to you as you plan, not just in your head! Low Budget and sustainable travel: Planning questions How would you like to travel? Planning a city trip? Want to enjoy a beach vacation? Go hiking? Experience nature? Think about what is important to you. Sustainable because:\xa0You think about your trip in advance and can make sustainable decisions from the start. For example, you don’t fly to Bali for a beach vacation because that’s what everyone else is doing, but you choose a vacation in Italy or Croatia. Where do I get what I want? Some destinations are cheaper than others because, for example, they are not yet overrun with tourists. Or because costs are generally lower than in your home country. Examples of such destinations are Albania, Croatia, or, if you want to go further afield, Vietnam Sustainable because:\xa0By traveling to less touristy areas instead of the popular hotspots, you help spread out the flow of people and counteract mass tourism. You also support the economy of a destination that would otherwise not benefit as much from travelers. When do I want to travel? Or even: Does it really have to be high season? Of course, if you are tied to vacation times or the like, you have little choice. But if you have a choice, it’s better to travel off-season. Accommodations and activities are often less expensive and it’s less crowded. In the low season, which follows the high season, almost everything is still open (restaurants, activities, etc.). The further away from the high season you travel, the cheaper the prices will be, but the more restaurants and other places may be closed. Sustainable because:\xa0Similar to choosing a destination, by traveling off-season, you not only help your wallet, but also spread out the tourist traffic over a longer period of time. In addition, you support the usually highly seasonal income of the owners and provide them with a more reliable income. Travel: Affordable and sustainable options How do I get to my destination? The journey is the reward” applies not only to slow travel, but also to planning a sustainable budget trip. Having this mindset is literally worth its weight in gold. If you treat your trip as part of your vacation, you will be more relaxed about the whole thing. Trust us 😉 So plan your trip, check out the trains (if you book early, they are usually not that expensive), or if you drive an (e-)car, plan to drive a little slower (saves fuel and CO2) and make a stopover for long trips. The cheapest option is often the long-distance bus. And since the network is constantly expanding, it has become a real alternative in recent years! According to recent surveys, it is also as environmentally friendly as the train. You can read more about this in our blog article about\xa0long-distance bus destinations\xa0in Europe. Sustainable because:\xa0Traveling by train and bus is the most environmentally friendly choice. Buses are usually the cheapest, but trains can also be quite inexpensive (if you book well in advance). However, we understand if you don’t want to (or can’t) rely on trains and prefer to travel by car. However, you can still apply the slow travel principle\xa0😉 Where and how do I want to stay? We know where we want to go, when we want to travel, and how we want to get there. The only thing we don’t have is a place to stay. For travelers on a budget, there are many options, from couchsurfing, housesitting and wwoofing to hostels or hotels. It all depends on your personal preferences, expectations and time constraints. Since we know hotels best, we’ll focus on that. As always, the best time to book is early! Some hotels even offer discounts if you book early! Check out the deals and packages the hotels have available and ideally choose a room with a small kitchenette or opt for an apartment or house with a kitchen so you can cook for yourself. You can often get special rates for longer stays. When in doubt, it is always worth asking the hotel directly (and booking anyway). Sustainable accommodation for less than 100 euros Sustainable accommodations are available for almost every budget. Even in the heart of Paris,\xa0Green Spirit Hotels offer private rooms and organic breakfasts without breaking the bank. You can also find cozy, family-friendly accommodations at the\xa0APIPURA hotel rinner\xa0on the Ritten in South Tyrol, where rooms start at €89.00 (including half-board). Sustainable because:\xa0You know us: we firmly believe that choosing sustainable accommodations (along with how you get there) is at the heart of sustainable travel. Whether it’s budget, luxury or anything in between. What do I really want to experience? To avoid tourist traps, long lines, or worse, missing out on your personal must-do or must-see, we recommend thinking about it in advance and building it into your budget planning. You can often book time slots for attractions or museums in advance and even get online discounts! (Some museums and similar places now even require you to do this!) You can also check out tourist passes from home and see if they are worthwhile for you, and you can compare tour providers if you want to take a particular tour. Of course, this does not apply to everything, as there are bound to be a number of (local) operators who are not represented on the Internet. Keep this in mind and find a good balance between planning and booking in advance and being spontaneous when you get there. Sustainable because:\xa0Research the area around your destination in advance. This will help you learn when certain attractions are packed so you can avoid those times. You may also find an insider tip or two for local restaurants or tour operators that you would not have found otherwise, and you will generally get a feel for your destination. You’ll also be less likely to be tempted into unsustainable activities once you get there. After all, you have a plan – one that you can and should be flexible with 🙂 Sustainable travel “on a budget” is not complicated Budget travel in general, and sustainable budget travel in particular, requires a higher level of planning than if you were going on a spur-of-the-moment adventure. In most cases – don’t get us wrong! With all the planning, there is only one thing to remember: Have fun! Don’t just look at your budget once you get there; stay spontaneous and open to opportunities to experience your vacation spot or destination authentically. You can lay the groundwork for this with sustainable budget travel planning.

Reducing your carbon footprint is no longer a “nice-to-have” but a business imperative in Australia. Many organisations have already addressed their Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions from energy use and generation. These scopes are regarded as the low-hanging fruit of emission reductions. Scope 3 emissions on the other hand, emissions sources that included purchased goods and services, events, and travel, have proven more difficult for organisations to manage, especially as they continue to grow. A comprehensive green travel plan isn’t just about reducing your environmental impact; it’s about enhancing your bottom line, improving employee morale, and strengthening your brand reputation. This guide outlines how Australian businesses can implement and benefit from implementing a robust green travel strategy. The Business Case for Green Travel Developing Your Green Travel Plan Driving Smarter Greener Alternatives: Tax Breaks and Incentives: Australian businesses should proactively develop and implement comprehensive green travel plans. This will not only reduce their environmental impact but also deliver significant cost savings, improve employee morale, and enhance their brand reputation. Start by assessing your current travel patterns, setting clear goals, and engaging your employees in the process.

Many sustainable hotels and vacation rentals will help you get to your destination by eco-friendly train – for example, with a first-class upgrade or a free electric shuttle to the nearest train station. In this article, we show you the different incentives and support options available through Green Pearls® partner accommodations. Extra tip: Book directly with the hotel and get help with your arrival First, a general tip for green and fair travel: Book your accommodations directly through the hotel’s website. It’s no secret that travel sites like Booking.com take a commission from hotels when you book through them. So while you pay the same room rate, the hotels get less of it. The sustainable accommodations featured in this article are all personally and individually managed and you can contact them directly – you will find links to their websites on the Green PearlsⓇ microsites that we link to here. Our tip for traveling by train: Contact the hotel or vacation rental before you book (by email or phone). Tell them you are booking directly with them, that you are coming by train, and ask if there is anything they can do to help you travel green. Often there are special offers, such as a day of free e-bike use, or you can “beat” a free shuttle ☺️ Especially if you are staying longer, a sustainable accommodation will often meet you halfway. How sustainable accommodations reward and support you when you travel by train Upgrade to first class for the train ride to Zermatt Car-free Zermatt in Switzerland is the perfect destination for a vacation close to nature by train. The Visp-Zermatt line is considered to be a particularly picturesque route through the Swiss picture-book countryside ( like a route of these routes that you can watch on YouTube to relax). The boutique hotel, with a small spa and views of the Matterhorn, is run by the Anthamatten family and is committed to sustainability in all areas (e.g. zero waste principles and regional organic products). Free public transportation pass or guest card Another great offer from eco-friendly hotels are free local transportation passes – so you can get around in a climate-friendly way during your stay. Eco-friendly accommodation and transportation in Freiburg The Green City Hotel Vauban in the beautiful German city of Freiburg im Breisgau is an example of this. The modern city hotel with its green facade is easily accessible by train. Take the train to Freiburg’s main station and from there the number 3 tram to Paula-Modersohn-Platz – the stop is right in front of the hotel. Green PearlsⓇ hotels on the Ritten in South Tyrol offer you the RittenCard The Ritten Plateau in South Tyrol is a popular destination for an active vacation in the Italian Alps. You won’t need a car here, as the entire region is exemplary in its commitment to environmentally friendly transportation. The RittenCard gives you free use of all local transport, including the historic mountain railway and the cable car to Bolzano, as well as free entry to some 90 museums, exhibitions and attractions. “Thanks to our Green Mobility service, the car is a distant memory,” reports the ADLER Lodge RITTEN*. Here you also receive a RittenCard, as well as the possibility to rent e-bikes and hire experienced guides to accompany you on hikes or e-bike tours. Arrival: From the Bolzano train station it is a 5 minute walk to the Renon cable car. The cable car leaves every 4 minutes and takes you to Soprabolzano in 12 minutes. Once there, a shuttle from ADLER Lodge RITTEN will be waiting for you. The RittenCard is also included in the room price at the APIPURA hotel rinner and will be sent to you before you arrive. You can also reach the hotel from Bolzano with the Ritten cable car and from Oberbozen with the Ritten train – the “Rinner” stop is right in front of the hotel! If you are a bee lover, you will love the APIPURA hotel rinner: the hotel has its own organic apiary, there is a bee nature trail and organic honey is served daily at the breakfast buffet. Eco-friendly hiking vacation in the Hohe Tauern National Park with a guest card East Tyrol also has a guest card that allows you to use public transportation and offers free or a discount at many attractions. You receive one as a guest at the family-run Naturhotel Outside in Matrei. The hotel is an official hiking hotel with a hiking concierge and also offers a free shuttle from Lienz train station (there and back). A shuttle from Kitzbühel train station is available for a fee. Complimentary e-Shuttle service powered by green electricity If you travel by train, you are already traveling in a pretty environmentally friendly way. Now imagine being picked up at the station by an e-shuttle powered by the hotel’s green electricity – pretty green and convenient, isn’t it? This is possible at the Hotel Das Rübezahl in Füssen (the train station is also located here). And once you are there, the best way to explore the picturesque Allgäu region with its panoramic view of Neuschwanstein Castle is on foot. Hiking concierge Bergbaschdi will be happy to assist you. The Birkenhof***** Spa & Genussresort Hotel in the Upper Palatinate Lake District will pick you up at Schwandorf train station with its own electric shuttle. The hotel includes a large spa area with several saunas and pools, as well as the 2-star restaurant Obendorfers Eisvogel – you’ll find it hard to find a reason to leave the premises 🙂 At the Hotel Klosterbräu in Tyrol, you can order the hotel’s “Green Shuttle” (an electric Viano bus) for free throughout the Seefeld area. The Seefeld ICE train station is only 200 meters from the hotel, so you can easily walk there. However, the shuttle is worthwhile if you have heavy or bulky luggage, such as ski equipment or the like. The sustainable hotel complex within the old monastery walls offers a wide range of services, including wellness, its own brewery, yoga classes, a petting zoo and child care. “The electric vehicle is a highlight for our guests,” reports the CERVO Mountain Resort in Zermatt. As mentioned above, the village of Zermatt is car-free, and apart from the electric vehicles, only horse-drawn carriages are allowed. The CERVO consists of several wooden chalets and has an award-winning design style. Rail and Hotel: More eco-friendly hotels with shuttle services in Europe To stay within the scope of this article, we will give you a brief overview of even more sustainable European hotels with shuttle services: Germany Austria Italy Eco-hotels in Paris and Milan Of course, city hotels in European metropolises are ideal for combining train and eco-hotel. “Paris has 6 train stations, and depending on which direction guests are coming from, they arrive at the appropriate station. From Germany, it is Gare de L’Est and Gare du Nord,” says Barbara Tascijevic-Porwoll of the Green Spirit Hotels. The Amelie, Malar and Le Pavilion hotels are all in the 7th arrondissement, within walking distance of the Eiffel Tower. By the way, Paris has done a lot to become more bike-friendly and has created many new bike paths! Of course, there is also the famous metro, which is an environmentally friendly way to get from A to B. The marbled Milan Central Station is also accessible from all over Europe with direct lines. Here, in the heart of the city, lies the Hotel Milano Scala, Italy’s first zero-emissions hotel. All electricity is generated by geothermal probes. From the train station to the hotel by bus, bike, or on foot For our more rural partners, traveling by train is not quite as easy – but no less appealing for it. “We recommend that you take your bike with you when you arrive by train. And then cycle the rest of the way from Eystrup or Nienburg station to us,” explain the host sisters at Hotel Okelmann’s in Warpe. The train stations are about 20 kilometers away and can be reached from Bremen or Hannover. There is also a lot to discover in the area by bike. The Okelmanns’ father is an enthusiastic cyclist himself and has entered several routes in komoot. The Gut Guntrams in Austria can be reached from Vienna’s Pitten train station. From there, it is a 25-minute walk along a forest nature trail to Guntramsburg. The hotel’s website offers a beautifully designed map of the trail, complete with photos and arrows. First by train, then by bus The Pfunds in Tirol bus stop is just one minute from the Summit Lodges Pfunds, so you can catch the bus right outside your vacation home. The spacious log cabin has its own sauna and fireplace! During the winter there is also a ski bus to the ski area. The nearest train station is Landeck-Zams. To get to the Naturresort Gerbehof by train, you must first get to the train station in Friedrichshafen on Lake Constance. The station is 5 kilometers from the resort and there are buses to Ailingen every 15 minutes. The walk from Ailingen bus station to Gerbehof is 1.2 kilometers. A little exercise in nature never hurts anyone, as they say! Alternatively, you can always take a taxi from the station to your accommodation. Either way, you are traveling in a climate-friendly way and keeping your carbon footprint small. Both by traveling and by choosing your accommodation. You may even find that you enjoy traveling by public transportation or bicycle and use them more at home. *CIN-Codes: IT021011A1AE4737IT (My Arbor), IT008010A1NIWKHTTF (Relais del Maro), IT021072A1L46PNBHX (Hotel Weihrerhof), IT021072A1UOWUIDH4 (APIPURA hotel rinner), IT021072A1QCJQTLUQ (ADLER Lodge RITTEN) Save the article for your next travel plans and arrival by train.']","{'qa_similarity': 0.7630506157875061, 'context_relevance': 0.6780487298965454, 'answer_length': 329, 'has_structure': False}"

Industrial animal farming, unsustainable fishing, and intensive monocultures are a few practices that have considerable negative effects on the environment, contributing to climate change and biodiversity loss. On the other hand, making sustainable food choices can help in minimizing these impacts. The global food system contributes to 21-37% of greenhouse gas emissions, and food waste alone contributes to 8-10% of these emissions. Therefore, making sustainable food choices can help in reducing these emissions significantly, thereby playing a significant role in eco-tourism.","[""When it comes to the climate emergency and biodiversity crisis we can’t ignore food. How and what we farm, fish, eat and dispose of are some of the biggest contributors to climate change and the loss of nature. Industrial animal farming (also known as a factory or intensive farming), unsustainable fishing, plants grown in intensive monocultures and overly processed food have created an unsustainable and inequitable food system that is not only having a negative impact on the climate and nature but also on animal welfare, farmworkers, local communities and our health. Food production methods, and their impact on both our climate and nature, vary from country to country and from farm to farm. There is just one consistency across the world: intensive farming and fishing practices are the main drivers of biodiversity loss on land and at sea and intensive meat production is one of the main causes of food-related carbon emissions. The global food system accounts for 21-37% of greenhouse gas emissions with meat and dairy being significant contributors. Another major contributor to climate change is food waste; this accounts for 8-10% of global greenhouse gas emissions. If food waste was a country it would be third behind the US and China in terms of climate emissions. 20% of food produced in the EU is wasted. It is commonly understood that a healthy diet is needed for a healthy body and to help prevent diet-related non-communicable diseases such as diabetes, heart disease, stroke and cancer; but a healthy diet is also needed for a healthy mind.

By drawing visitors out of tourism hotspots to more remote regions, protected area tourism can bring new benefits to rural communities and indigenous populations.While protected areas provide significant economic value, there tends to be little data to actually back this up. Without reliable and quantifiable evidence, governments and communities may undervalue these natural areas and the benefits they deliver. As a result, important visitor management and conservation activities may be overlooked. Without these types of sustainability measures in place, tourism growth in protected areas can end up harming their fragile environments. \n\n\n\nOur Role \n\n\n\nOne destination focused on developing sustainable tourism in its protected areas is Panama. The country’s 121 protected areas cover over 6.2 million hectares of rainforests, coastal reefs, and other sensitive habitats. An increasing number of visitors come to these areas for nature-based tourism experiences, such as trekking, snorkeling, rock climbing, and birdwatching.In 2017, Sustainable Travel International conducted an economic impact study to determine the value of these natural areas. For this study, our team examined the economic benefits generated by tourism activities within Panama’s protected areas as a way to measure their value.We began by reviewing Panama’s existing tourism data. This included more general statistics such as national visitor arrivals, protected areas statistics, and public use plans.To supplement this data, we collected more specific data on tourism revenues linked to protected areas. \xa0We surveyed businesses in Panama’s protected areas and their surrounding buffer zones. Five protected areas were included in this pilot study: Camino de Cruces National Park, Altos De Campana National Park, La Amistad International Park, Chagres National Park, and Soberanía National Park. Survey participants were asked to provide information about their business, including the services they offer and their revenues.In addition to collecting data from businesses, our team also interviewed visitors to these areas. Through these interviews, we were able to gain a better understanding of who is visiting Panama’s protected areas, what they are doing, and where they are spending their money. \xa0\xa0\xa0The study findings paint a fuller picture of the different groups that are operating in and benefiting from Panama’s protected areas. It also quantifies the economic value of protected area tourism. An added benefit of this research approach is that it provides data not only on impacts at the national level, but also on the value generated for local communities.The real impact of this data lies in its potential to influence destination planning and decision-making. By demonstrating the value of protected areas to the tourism industry, local communities, and the country as a whole, this data helps reinforce the importance of caring for these areas. We hope this data incentivizes improved conservation and leads to better visitor management in protected areas.Header Photo Credit: Billtacular via\xa0Flickr \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProject Type \n\n\n\nDestination: Panama \n\n\n\nRegion: Central America \n\n\n\nLocation \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDates\n \n\n\n\n2017 \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOur Partners \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExplore More Destination Projects \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNet Zero Training for Barbados\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAssessing the Carrying Capacity of\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSt. Kitts Destination Guardians\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPalau: Carbon Neutral Tourism Destination\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDeveloping Sustainable Tourism Initiatives in\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMonitoring Lenga Tree Reforestation in\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSustainable Tourism Course for Small\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInvesting in the Development of\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSustainable Tourism Enterprise Program for\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMesoamerican Reef Tourism Initiative (MARTI)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKawésqar Community Tourism & Empowerment\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRestoring the Base Torres Trail\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProtect the Places You Love \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHelp conserve our planet’s most vulnerable destinations and empower the people who live there.

The hotel is an official hiking hotel with a hiking concierge and also offers a free shuttle from Lienz train station (there and back). A shuttle from Kitzbühel train station is available for a fee. Complimentary e-Shuttle service powered by green electricity If you travel by train, you are already traveling in a pretty environmentally friendly way. Now imagine being picked up at the station by an e-shuttle powered by the hotel’s green electricity – pretty green and convenient, isn’t it? This is possible at the Hotel Das Rübezahl in Füssen (the train station is also located here). And once you are there, the best way to explore the picturesque Allgäu region with its panoramic view of Neuschwanstein Castle is on foot. Hiking concierge Bergbaschdi will be happy to assist you. The Birkenhof***** Spa & Genussresort Hotel in the Upper Palatinate Lake District will pick you up at Schwandorf train station with its own electric shuttle. The hotel includes a large spa area with several saunas and pools, as well as the 2-star restaurant Obendorfers Eisvogel – you’ll find it hard to find a reason to leave the premises 🙂 At the Hotel Klosterbräu in Tyrol, you can order the hotel’s “Green Shuttle” (an electric Viano bus) for free throughout the Seefeld area. The Seefeld ICE train station is only 200 meters from the hotel, so you can easily walk there. However, the shuttle is worthwhile if you have heavy or bulky luggage, such as ski equipment or the like. The sustainable hotel complex within the old monastery walls offers a wide range of services, including wellness, its own brewery, yoga classes, a petting zoo and child care. “The electric vehicle is a highlight for our guests,” reports the CERVO Mountain Resort in Zermatt. As mentioned above, the village of Zermatt is car-free, and apart from the electric vehicles, only horse-drawn carriages are allowed. The CERVO consists of several wooden chalets and has an award-winning design style. Rail and Hotel: More eco-friendly hotels with shuttle services in Europe To stay within the scope of this article, we will give you a brief overview of even more sustainable European hotels with shuttle services: Germany Austria Italy Eco-hotels in Paris and Milan Of course, city hotels in European metropolises are ideal for combining train and eco-hotel. “Paris has 6 train stations, and depending on which direction guests are coming from, they arrive at the appropriate station. From Germany, it is Gare de L’Est and Gare du Nord,” says Barbara Tascijevic-Porwoll of the Green Spirit Hotels. The Amelie, Malar and Le Pavilion hotels are all in the 7th arrondissement, within walking distance of the Eiffel Tower. By the way, Paris has done a lot to become more bike-friendly and has created many new bike paths! Of course, there is also the famous metro, which is an environmentally friendly way to get from A to B. The marbled Milan Central Station is also accessible from all over Europe with direct lines. Here, in the heart of the city, lies the Hotel Milano Scala, Italy’s first zero-emissions hotel. All electricity is generated by geothermal probes. From the train station to the hotel by bus, bike, or on foot For our more rural partners, traveling by train is not quite as easy – but no less appealing for it. “We recommend that you take your bike with you when you arrive by train. And then cycle the rest of the way from Eystrup or Nienburg station to us,” explain the host sisters at Hotel Okelmann’s in Warpe. The train stations are about 20 kilometers away and can be reached from Bremen or Hannover. There is also a lot to discover in the area by bike. The Okelmanns’ father is an enthusiastic cyclist himself and has entered several routes in komoot. The Gut Guntrams in Austria can be reached from Vienna’s Pitten train station. From there, it is a 25-minute walk along a forest nature trail to Guntramsburg. The hotel’s website offers a beautifully designed map of the trail, complete with photos and arrows. First by train, then by bus The Pfunds in Tirol bus stop is just one minute from the Summit Lodges Pfunds, so you can catch the bus right outside your vacation home. The spacious log cabin has its own sauna and fireplace! During the winter there is also a ski bus to the ski area. The nearest train station is Landeck-Zams. To get to the Naturresort Gerbehof by train, you must first get to the train station in Friedrichshafen on Lake Constance. The station is 5 kilometers from the resort and there are buses to Ailingen every 15 minutes. The walk from Ailingen bus station to Gerbehof is 1.2 kilometers. A little exercise in nature never hurts anyone, as they say! Alternatively, you can always take a taxi from the station to your accommodation. Either way, you are traveling in a climate-friendly way and keeping your carbon footprint small. Both by traveling and by choosing your accommodation. You may even find that you enjoy traveling by public transportation or bicycle and use them more at home. *CIN-Codes: IT021011A1AE4737IT (My Arbor), IT008010A1NIWKHTTF (Relais del Maro), IT021072A1L46PNBHX (Hotel Weihrerhof), IT021072A1UOWUIDH4 (APIPURA hotel rinner), IT021072A1QCJQTLUQ (ADLER Lodge RITTEN) Save the article for your next travel plans and arrival by train.', ""According to Eurostat, household energy usage represents about a quarter of final energy consumption in Europe. Energy usage leads to carbon emissions and the amount of carbon that we use is related to how clean (renewable energy) or dirty (fossil fuels) the energy grid is (power stations). This can vary quite a lot depending on which country you are based in. Countries that depend mostly on coal and gas will have higher emissions per kWh of energy used, compared to those that predominantly rely on renewable energy such as geothermal. There are many ways through which we can have control over the energy that we use (e.g. we can use a tariff that uses green energy or decide on the areas of the house where we can reduce our usage) if we want to reduce our impact on the environment. With energy prices rising across Europe it is more important than ever to understand ways through which we can reduce our usage, not only from the sustainability perspective, but also for our pocket. When on a year/ semester abroad, you are likely to be renting, rather than living in an apartment that you own, therefore our advice is going to mostly focus on what you can do as a renter.

2025-01-25T22:10:31.641927,How to integrate sustainable practices into business travel?,"To integrate sustainable practices into business travel, you can consider the following:

1. Choose Accommodation Wisely: Support hotels that function sustainably and create fair jobs, like the Green City Hotel Vauban in Freiburg, Germany, an integration project employing people with disabilities and committed to long period sustainability in the region.

2. Reduce Resource Consumption: Utilize renewable resources wherever possible. For example, Hotel Milano Scala switched to geothermal energy along with implementing photovoltaic systems, heat pump technology, and heat recovery measures to reduce their reliance on fossil fuels.

3. Upcycle: Try to use furnishings that have been upcycled, or consider accommodations that employ upcycling in their furnishing. 

4. Support Local Communities: Whenever you can, choose travel options that support local communities, like the Albergo Diffuso movement in Italy, which helps revive Italian villages and local economies.

5. Preserve the Environment: Support hotels that are committed to preserving their local environment, such as Casa León Royal Retreat in Gran Canaria, which has established a natural garden filled native plants and uses natural pest control.

6. Opt for Sustainable Transportation: Consider using public transport, bike rentals, or car-sharing services to reach business meeting locations. This not only helps in reducing carbon emissions but also helps in promoting sustainable commuting practices.

7. Embrace Minimalism: Travel light and limit the resources you consume on your business trip. Take what you only need. 

8. Buy Local: When buying items or foods, opt for locally sourced and produced goods when possible. This supports local businesses and reduces the carbon footprint associated with shipping goods.

In sum, to travel sustainably, consider your accommodation, transportation, food, and buying choices and opt for those choices that support local communities and the environment while reducing your carbon footprint.","['10 TIPS FOR TRAVELING SUSTAINABLY', 'On our blog we often talk about HOW to travel sustainable. Today, though, we want to talk about WHY it is important. We’ll give away this much: it’s not just about protecting the environment. Ultimately, sustainable travel benefits you personally. #1 Tourism as an economic factor The tourism industry is an important economic factor – in some countries it is the most important. Your vacation sets your money in motion, helping to redistribute wealth and pay workers. Hotels are often large businesses with many employees, subcontractors, suppliers, etc. who also benefit from a financially successful hotel. Unfortunately, not all hotels are sustainable and socially responsible, and often your money does not benefit your vacation destination at all. You may travel to a hotel in Thailand and your money ends up with an investor in the US or Japan. Some hotels employ seasonal workers who live in shabby accommodations (I was told this for a German island, for example). By consciously choosing a hotel that operates in a sustainable and usually fair manner, you ensure that your money really benefits the region and creates fair jobs. Support fair labor practices in hotels One example is the Green City Hotel Vauban in Freiburg, Germany. This sustainable city hotel is an integration project, and half of all employees are people with physical and/or mental disabilities. The hotel has deep roots in Freiburg. Its shareholders are the Vereinigung Freiburger Sozialarbeit e.V. and the Freiburger Stadtbau GmbH. Even abroad, you have many opportunities to use your purchasing power to help other people (instead of supporting their exploitation). At our Green PearlsⓇ partner Farmhouse Smiling Gecko in Cambodia, the luxury resort ensures the financing of the Smiling Gecko NGO’s training centers, school and organic farm, and also serves as a training center and employer itself. #2 preserving resources You probably already know this: Planet B does not exist. The idea that we could someday completely deplete our planet of all its resources, destroy all animal and plant species (and perhaps even entire populations), and live on Mars from then on is NOT realistic! Fossil resources such as oil, coal and natural gas are finite. This means that they are taken from the Earth and then they are gone. Theoretically, these resources will eventually reform, but in the case of oil, for example, it takes at least 10,000 years for new oil to form from dead plant matter and plankton. We should all be aware that what we consume today will not be available to our children, grandchildren, great-grandchildren and future generations. Renewable energy in the hospitality industry In our opinion, one of the requirements for a sustainable hotel is to run on renewable energy. The least you can do is get 100% green electricity (something you can easily do at home by simply switching your electricity provider). But many hotels go further. For example, our partner Hotel Milano Scala was the first Zero Emission Hotel in Italy. It is powered by geothermal energy, a renewable energy source that “significantly reduces greenhouse gas emissions,” according to the Ministry of the Environment, Climate and Energy. Other hotels and residences rely on their own combined heat and power plants, heat pump technologies, photovoltaic and solar thermal systems, and heat recovery measures to reduce their own consumption of fossil resources while minimizing CO2 emissions. Upcycling and organic Conserving resources is not only about energy, but also about buildings and furnishings. The HUBERTUS Mountain Refugio Allgäu recently renovated its hotel rooms using a sustainable upcycling concept. Instead of buying new furniture, the existing solid wood furniture in the rooms was simply dismantled, the (outdated) decorations removed and the furniture reworked. The new composition created modern furniture without cutting down any trees! (You can learn more about this in this YouTube video by owner Marc Traubel and interior designer Sarah Stapelfeld) Throughout Biohotel Grafenast you will find sustainable and natural materials such as solid wood and local stone. The eco-friendly hotel is also committed to organic farming and uses only organic food – whenever possible, directly from the region and from the hotel’s own “Sehnsuchtsgarten” (garden of longing). Short delivery distances mean fewer greenhouse gases, and the absence of pesticides helps preserve biodiversity. #3 Promote nature and species conservation Which brings us to the next argument: sustainable travel supports conservation. Take, for example, the Casa León Royal Retreat in Gran Canaria. This small boutique hotel in the interior of the island has created a garden of native plants on its 10,000-square-meter property and uses only natural pest control. Here you can see a variety of small animals, such as the Canary Island bullfinch – the original form of the domesticated canary! The hotel uses a rainwater cistern system for irrigation. In another sustainable initiative, the family that owns Casa León Royal Retreat has leased a 40,000-square-foot piece of forest in the Balkans that is maintained but still largely untouched. This has created another protected area for animals and plants in this world, which also helps the climate. #4 Experience the country and its people in an authentic way Sustainable travel means going off the beaten track and visiting places away from the usual mass tourism destinations. This gives you a real opportunity to experience the country you are visiting and get to know the locals. Albergi Diffusi is saving villages in Italy In Italy, the Albergo Diffuso movement has helped save Italian villages from decay. An Albergo Diffuso is a hotel spread over several buildings in a village. You live among the locals. Our Green PearlsⓇ partner Relais del Maro is a prime example. Owner Elena Scalambrin converted several of her family’s commercial and residential buildings into a 4-star hotel. Guests arrive at the main house with a reception for dinner (and the pool), but otherwise stay in lovingly decorated rooms in the middle of the village community. The hotel has helped keep the village bakery and other local businesses alive. Here you will be able to experience the real Liguria and see the positive effects of sustainable tourism at first hand. #5 Learning to love nature “In the end, we will conserve only what we love” – Baba Dioum, Senegalese forestry engineer and conservationist It is easy to understand Baba Dioum’s famous quote, delivered at a biodiversity conference in India in 1968. As we showed in our blog post on insect extinction, many animals and plants simply do not have a strong “lobby”. We think of some bugs and algae as expendable. It is only when we understand the important role they play that we learn to love them and work to conserve them. Guided hikes in the Allgäu At Hotel Das Rübezahl in Füssen, you have the opportunity to discover nature with the hotel’s own hiking guide. “Bergbaschdi” will take you into the mountains and show you the flora and fauna. You are sure to discover things you would otherwise have missed. (Read more in our interview with the hiking concierge) Experience glaciers live in Switzerland Glaciers are also very interesting. These “eternal” masses of ice are the largest reservoirs of fresh water on our planet, and they are in danger of disappearing! Fabienne Anthamatten of the Hotel Bella Vista Zermatt can tell you all about it. Her hotel has an 8,000-year-old larch tree that she found on a former glacier field. This means that the trunk was preserved in the ice for several thousand years and has now been uncovered. On a trip to the glaciers, you can admire the fascinating masses of ice (there are still many kilometers left) and better understand the connections to global warming. #6 Have a vision – and think about the future Just being in the present moment is a beautiful mindfulness exercise. But you should also have a vision in your life. A vision is a motivating, positive idea about the future. And that’s what sustainable travel is all about. According to the UN, sustainable tourism is: “Tourism that takes full account of its current and future economic, social and environmental impacts.” So it’s thinking about the NOW as well as the FUTURE and taking responsibility for it. If you can do that, you’re doing pretty well. And what better way to learn how to do that and develop your own vision of the future than to travel the world sustainably and be inspired by other visionaries? If that’s not a good argument for sustainable travel, I don’t know what is? Save this article to Pinterest and share it with your friends!

2025-01-25T22:10:41.400723,What are innovative sustainable tourism initiatives around the world?,"Innovative sustainable tourism initiatives around the world include:

1. Panama's approach for sustainable tourism in protected areas: Panama has focused on developing sustainable tourism initiatives in its 121 protected areas, which cover over 6.2 million hectares of diverse habitats. Sustainable Travel International conducted an economic impact study in 2017, assessing the economic benefits created by tourism activities within these protected areas. The study involved an extensive data collection process, interviewing visitors, and surveying businesses within the protected areas and their surrounding zones.

2. Sustainable Tourism Course for Small Island Developing States (SIDS): This initiative is meant to guide small island destinations towards a more sustainable future. The course, which is offered as an open online course in partnership with Hamburg University of Applied Sciences and the Hamburg Open Online University (HOOU), aims to address the shared challenges and promote the sustainable development of tourism in SIDS.

3. Advocacy through Sustainable Travel Blogs: Numerous travel bloggers have dedicated their platforms to disseminating information on sustainable travel, sharing tips, and inspiring people to travel more responsibly. Blogs like Green Global Travel, The Poor Traveler, The Planet D, and Travel for Wildlife provide information on sustainable practices in tourism, animal welfare, community-based tourism, and supporting local communities.

4. Training & Education: Various programs have been designed for educating key stakeholder groups about sustainable tourism. This capacity building contributes to the development of more sustainable tourism initiatives globally.

5. Mesoamerican Reef Tourism Initiative (MARTI): This focuses on developing sustainable tourism efforts that protect the delicate Mesoamerican Reef system while also supporting local economies.

6. Kawésqar Community Tourism & Empowerment: This project fosters sustainable tourism within the Kawésqar community in Chile, providing locals with the opportunity to share their cultural heritage in a way that sustains their local economy while also conserving their unique environment. 

All these initiatives show different approaches to sustainable tourism around the world, each with unique strategies to protect local environments and their communities.","['Tourism in protected areas is a growing economic activity in many countries. By drawing visitors out of tourism hotspots to more remote regions, protected area tourism can bring new benefits to rural communities and indigenous populations.While protected areas provide significant economic value, there tends to be little data to actually back this up. Without reliable and quantifiable evidence, governments and communities may undervalue these natural areas and the benefits they deliver. As a result, important visitor management and conservation activities may be overlooked. Without these types of sustainability measures in place, tourism growth in protected areas can end up harming their fragile environments. \n\n\n\nOur Role \n\n\n\nOne destination focused on developing sustainable tourism in its protected areas is Panama. The country’s 121 protected areas cover over 6.2 million hectares of rainforests, coastal reefs, and other sensitive habitats. An increasing number of visitors come to these areas for nature-based tourism experiences, such as trekking, snorkeling, rock climbing, and birdwatching.In 2017, Sustainable Travel International conducted an economic impact study to determine the value of these natural areas. For this study, our team examined the economic benefits generated by tourism activities within Panama’s protected areas as a way to measure their value.We began by reviewing Panama’s existing tourism data. This included more general statistics such as national visitor arrivals, protected areas statistics, and public use plans.To supplement this data, we collected more specific data on tourism revenues linked to protected areas. \xa0We surveyed businesses in Panama’s protected areas and their surrounding buffer zones. Five protected areas were included in this pilot study: Camino de Cruces National Park, Altos De Campana National Park, La Amistad International Park, Chagres National Park, and Soberanía National Park. Survey participants were asked to provide information about their business, including the services they offer and their revenues.In addition to collecting data from businesses, our team also interviewed visitors to these areas. Through these interviews, we were able to gain a better understanding of who is visiting Panama’s protected areas, what they are doing, and where they are spending their money. \xa0\xa0\xa0The study findings paint a fuller picture of the different groups that are operating in and benefiting from Panama’s protected areas. It also quantifies the economic value of protected area tourism. An added benefit of this research approach is that it provides data not only on impacts at the national level, but also on the value generated for local communities.The real impact of this data lies in its potential to influence destination planning and decision-making. By demonstrating the value of protected areas to the tourism industry, local communities, and the country as a whole, this data helps reinforce the importance of caring for these areas. We hope this data incentivizes improved conservation and leads to better visitor management in protected areas.Header Photo Credit: Billtacular via\xa0Flickr \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProject Type \n\n\n\nDestination: Panama \n\n\n\nRegion: Central America \n\n\n\nLocation \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDates\n \n\n\n\n2017 \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOur Partners \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExplore More Destination Projects \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNet Zero Training for Barbados\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAssessing the Carrying Capacity of\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSt. Kitts Destination Guardians\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPalau: Carbon Neutral Tourism Destination\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDeveloping Sustainable Tourism Initiatives in\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMonitoring Lenga Tree Reforestation in\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSustainable Tourism Course for Small\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInvesting in the Development of\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSustainable Tourism Enterprise Program for\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMesoamerican Reef Tourism Initiative (MARTI)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKawésqar Community Tourism & Empowerment\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRestoring the Base Torres Trail\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProtect the Places You Love \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHelp conserve our planet’s most vulnerable destinations and empower the people who live there.

2025-01-25T22:10:46.754423,How do you choose eco-friendly travel gear and equipment?,"Choosing eco-friendly travel gear and equipment should involve several aspects including the material, lifespan, and functionality of the product. Firstly, opt for gear and equipment produced from sustainable or recycled materials. Products such as the Hoka Bondi SR shoes, Patagonia Nano Puff Hoody, and Eddie Bauer Women's Departure Blazer are made from recycled materials and are excellent examples of eco-friendly choices. 

Secondly, ensure that the gear or equipment is multifunctional and durable to serve several purposes, which will avoid the need to buy additional items. Examples include wind-resistant backpacks that double as carry-ons or shirts like the Athleta Endless Cargo High-Rise pants that are suitable for a range of activities.

Finally, consider brands that exercise sustainable practices, like Unbound Merino which offers recyclable clothing or Monos Slim Wallet which is made from vegan leather. 

By implementing these tips, you can choose eco-friendly travel gear and equipment that matches your needs accurately while minimizing your environmental impact.
","['Pack Sustainable: 4 Easy Tips for Lightweight Travel\nConsumption Rules for Sustainable Living: Embracing Minimalism and Eco-Friendly Lifestyle', ""National Geographic content straight to your inbox—sign up for our popular newsletters here Our definitive annual list includes everything a traveler needs, from multifunctional bags to comfortable travel clothes. Starry-eyed adventurers may need only the clothes on their backs, but fortifying travels with a tailored kit will help smooth the way. That doesn’t mean every bag and gadget is essential for travel. Each piece must earn its keep, serving not just one purpose but several, in some instances. (Think a backpack carry-on or scarf with discreet zippered pockets.) After all, the best travel kit serves its unique traveler: you. Thankfully, the past year introduced some seriously innovative gear, and this year is poised to be just as promising. With that in mind, we’ve put together this definitive list of all the travel products we love most, from recent hits to new and improved releases. Our picks for the best travel essentials in 2025 Travel essentials is a broad term. For easier navigation, this list is divided into three categories: bags, clothes, and accessories. From wind-resistant backpacks that double as carry-ons to breathable, wrinkle-resistant shirts that transition from formal dinners to hiking excursions, here’s everything worth packing for your next adventure. Jump to your favorite category The best travel bags for 2025 Back to top Best travel backpack: Peak Design Travel Backpack 45L Peak Design Travel Backpack 45L For many travelers, packing all your belongings in a single bag is a dream. This backpack makes that dream a reality. At first glance, it looks like a standard 35L backpack, but it expands to a whopping 45L. Even the side pockets extend to hold bulky items like tripods and canteens. Thoughtful design features include quick-access pockets and internal dividers to keep gear organized, as well as padded straps and waist support for comfort. Best travel laptop backpack: Thule Aion 40L Thule Aion 40L With more luggage capacity and organizational pockets than your typical backpack, the Thule Aion 40L is ideal for travelers who can’t escape work. The dedicated tech pouch fits laptops up to 16 inches and tablets up to 12.9 inches. Plenty of separate zippered pockets wrangle cords, chargers, and other small accessories. The main compartment has compression straps for clothes and a removable TPU rolltop bag to keep moisture-prone items separate from pricey electronics. (8 expert-loved backpacks for your next hiking adventure) Best travel toiletry bag: Peak Design Wash Pouch Peak Design Wash Pouch This compact toiletry bag offers a surprisingly spacious interior and innovative compartments to separate items you don’t want to mix (looking at you, magnetically sealed toothbrush pocket). The pull-out pocket linings make it easy to wipe up spills, plus the built-in hook lets you hang the bag away from wet surfaces or when counter space is limited. Best travel purse: Cuyana Easy Travel Bag Cuyana Easy Travel Bag The soft Italian leather may be reason enough to add this lightweight tote to a packing wish list, but the practical design will have travelers reaching for it for every trip. With multiple pockets, a key clip, a secure zipper closure, and a roomy interior, it’s perfect for stowing essentials in style. If you need more organization, Cuyana offers add-on bags and longer shoulder straps that snap in. Best travel suitcase: Samsonite Outline Pro Carry-On Spinner Samsonite Outline Pro Carry-On Spinner Inside the sleek exterior (which comes in five trendy colors) lies an adaptable packing system with compression straps, zippered pockets, panel dividers, and wet compartments. The 360-degree spinner wheels make maneuvering through crowded airports much less stressful, and the durable polycarbonate shell can withstand the bumps and bangs of travel. It’s no wonder this particular collection is a favorite among pilots and flight attendants. (These are our favorite carry-on bags) Best crossbody bag for travel: Cotopaxi Coso 2L Hip Pack Cada Día Cotopaxi Coso 2L Hip Pack Cada Dia There’s a reason this hip pack keeps popping up on our experts’ best lists; it’s versatile, stylish, and functional. The 2L size is perfect for on-the-go essentials like a wallet, phone, sunglasses, and small snacks. It also features a hidden zip pocket on the back for added security. We love that you can wear it as a crossbody or fanny pack for hands-free convenience that doesn’t compromise style. Best travel duffle bag: Herschel Novel Duffle Herschel Novel Duffel We love the built-in shoe compartment in this duffle for keeping dusty hiking boots away from clean clothes. That feature along with the zippered mesh internal pocket and side sleeve pouch make this duffle a better option than most for organization. Plus, the waterproof zipper and 42.5-liter capacity make it a reliable choice for weekend trips or as a secondary bag on longer journeys, especially if showers are in the forecast. Best carry-on travel bag: Nex Pioneer 20-inch Hawaii Edition Nex Pioneer 20-Inch Hawaii Edition The carry-ons that promise more space tend to push the limits of airline size regulations. This carry-on has smart design features—like two interior pockets built with overpackers in mind—that maximize existing space. While the recycled polycarbonate hard-shell exterior is made to resist dents, Nex’s Million-Mile Return policy allows travelers to return used bags for credits toward a new one, up to a million miles traveled. Best fanny pack for travel: Lululemon Everywhere Belt Bag Lululemon Everywhere Belt Bag Don’t want to fiddle around with pockets and zippers while traveling? This stylish belt bag keeps essentials within arm’s reach. Travelers won’t find advanced organizational features, but the single interior mesh pocket and zippered back pocket are plenty for cards, keys, and a small phone. Plus, the water-repellant polyester and nylon fabric helps keep belongings safe from unexpected spills or light rain. (Go hands-free while you travel with a crossbody bag) Best travel case for camera: Thule Aspect DSLR Camera Bag Backpack Thule Aspect DSLR Camera Bag Backpack This durable and functional backpack is built with a customizable padded interior that allows travelers to organize camera equipment as they see fit. At the same time, it provides quick access when that perfect shot presents itself. The backpack also has a separate laptop sleeve for a 15.6-inch laptop and a tablet—convenient for keeping all your tech together. (The 25 best places in the world to travel to in 2025) The best travel clothes for 2025 Back to top Best travel pants for women: Athleta Endless Cargo High-Rise Athleta Endless Cargo High-Rise The Athleta Endless Cargo High-Rise pants are as versatile as pants can get. The stretchy recycled polyester and spandex material is breathable, wrinkle-resistant, quick-drying, and stylish enough for a day of hiking or exploring the city. You can adjust the cuffed ankle hem for a cropped or full-length look. We also like the slim cargo pockets and all the colors and sizes. Best travel pants for men: Outerknown Field Pant Outerknown Field Pant Made from organic cotton in Sri Lanka, these ’70s military trouser-style pants are tough as nails, yet comfortable with an adjustable waistband and roomy pockets. The tapered leg opening gives knees a little more room to move, while the button-flap back pocket adds a touch of style and security. Best travel shirt for women: Patagonia Women’s Capilene Cool Daily Shirt Patagonia Women’s Capilene Cool Daily Shirt The most pack-worthy travel garments go with multiple outfits and are easy to clean. Patagonia’s Capilene Cool Daily Shirt is both. With built-in wicking and odor control, this classic tee is made to withstand the effects of a long hike or bike ride. The minimal seams and soft, recycled polyester material help this top prevent chafing and feel comfortable in many climates. Best travel shirt for men: Outerknown Blanket Shirt Outerknown Blanket Shirt The name says it all: The organic cotton twill feels about as soft as a favorite blanket. With a modern relaxed fit and classic design, this shirt can be dressed up for dinner or thrown over a tee for a casual day. The variety of muted color options make it easy to style with any outfit, while the durable construction ensures it will last through many trips. Whether you wear it on its own or under a jacket, this button-up is sure to be a keeper. Best comfy travel outfit for women: Quince Mongolian Cashmere Straight Leg Pants and Full-Zip Hoodie Quince Cashmere Pants Quince Zip-Up Hoodie When you’re facing a 16-hour flight, comfort is key, and few things are more comfortable than cashmere. Quince’s Mongolian Straight Leg Pants and Full-Zip Hoodie are constructed out of 100 percent Grade-A Mongolian cashmere that feels warm and luxurious without being too bulky. The pants have a comfortable drawstring waistband, while the hoodie has a relaxed fit that’s perfect for layering over a T-shirt. Best comfy travel outfit for men: Unbound Merino Slim Travel Pants and Cashmere Hoodie Unbound Merino Slim Travel Pants Unbound Merino Cashmere Hoodie This pant-and-hoodie combo is comfortable enough for an in-flight nap and stylish enough to hit a happy hour after landing. The pants are made from the brand’s signature Italian merino wool, which is odor-resistant, quick-drying, and wrinkle-free. The hoodie is a blend of merino wool and cashmere, giving it all the same benefits as the pants with added softness, plus it’s machine washable. Best compression socks for travel: Bombas Everyday Compression Socks Bombas Everyday Compression Socks We appreciate that these Bombas Everyday Compression Socks are made with medium compression that’s targeted at the ankle and relaxed around the calf. The result is a wearable fit that helps support achy legs and keep swelling down. Bonus: Bombas says it donates an essential item of clothing to homeless shelters for every pair of socks sold. Best travel dress: Unbound Mini Merino Travel Dress Unbound Mini Merino Travel Dress Dresses can be difficult to pack. The Unbound Mini Merino Travel Dress is lightweight and wrinkle-resistant, making it perfect for stuffing into a carry-on. The merino wool is naturally antibacterial so you can wear it multiple times before washing. With a versatile look that dresses up or down and four classic color options, travelers will get a ton of mileage out of this travel dress. Best travel jacket for women: Patagonia Nano Puff Hoody Patagonia Nano Puff Hoody A lightweight and packable jacket is an essential for any traveler and the Patagonia Nano Puff Hoody is one of the best. Both the shell and the insulation are made of recycled polyester. The latter is treated with P.U.R.E. (Produced Using Reduced Emissions) technology that helps lock in warmth, even when it gets wet. We also love the zippered hood and pockets—particularly the internal chest pocket that doubles as a stuff sack with a built-in carabiner loop. (Stay dry with top-notch rain jackets for men and women) Best travel jacket for men: Outerknown Puffer Outerknown Puffer When you’re venturing to colder climates, you need an insulated jacket that isn’t bulky. Soft and durable, the Outerknown Puffer gets its insulation from recycled down and its lightweight shell from recycled fishing nets, according to the company. The fleece-lined zip pockets are just an extra cozy touch that you’ll be thankful for when the temperature drops. Best travel vest for women: L.L. Bean Packaway Vest L.L. Bean Packaway Vest Multiseasonal layering is a must when packing light. Made from water-resistant PrimaLoft Gold insulation (a planet-friendly synthetic alternative to down), the L.L. Bean PackAway Vest can handle rain, wind, and mild temperatures. It’s designed with two zippered hand pockets, a zippered chest pocket, and an internal media pocket. Even cooler, the vest packs into the media pocket. (These are the most comfortable travel clothes for women) Best travel vest for men: Stio Hometown Down Hooded Vest Stio Hometown Down Hooded Vest Insulated vests serve a dual purpose: They add an extra layer of warmth and allow for more mobility compared to a full jacket. The Stio Hometown Down Hooded Vest is the perfect example of this, with its 800-fill Responsible Down Standard-certified insulation and durable water repellent (DWR) finish. It also has all the pockets you need for storing essentials, including two hand warmers and an interior one for stashing stuff like a wallet. We also love the fixed hood for chilly mornings on the slopes or unexpected rain showers. Best travel blazer for women: Eddie Bauer Women’s Departure Blazer Eddie Bauer Women’s Departure Blazer Even if most of your adventures call for rugged attire, it’s good to have at least one polished piece in your suitcase. The Eddie Bauer Women’s Departure Blazer offers more than just a professional look. The lightweight, polyester spandex blend fabric is stretchy, moisture wicking, and UPF 50+ rated. It’s available in four versatile colors for effortless, dressed-up fits. A hidden zippered pocket is great for stashing valuables. Best travel blazer for men: Relwen Flyweight Flex Blazer Relwen Flyweight Flex Blazer The Relwen Flyweight Flex Blazer is made of soft cotton that’s meant to look wrinkled, so you can cross off ironing from your to-do list. This casual sports blazer is made to last with reinforced stitching, yet it has an unfussy laid-back look that’s right at home anywhere. Best travel shoes: Hoka Bondi SR\xa0(women’s; men’s) Women’s Hoka Bondi SR Men’s Hoka Bondi SR Nothing slows down a trip faster than achy feet. Keep arches happy and toes protected with a pair of supportive sneakers like the Hoka Bondi SRs. These shoes are designed for maximum cushioning and support, making them perfect for long days of sightseeing. They also have a non-slip sole and an easy slip-on design that makes them great for airport security lines. (Explore for hours in a cushy Hoka walking shoe) Best travel slippers for women: UGG Tasman Slipper Ugg Tasman Slipper The foam footbed and sheepskin-wool blend on these cozy slippers are made for comfort. Yet the EVA outsole (made from sugarcane) is durable enough for light outdoor wear—perfect for the airport. Best travel slippers for men: The North Face ThermoBall Traction Water Resistant Slipper The North Face Water Resistant Slipper If you don’t think slippers are worth the suitcase space, these North Face ThermoBall Traction Mules may make you reconsider. They are lightweight, water-resistant, insulated, and exactly what sore feet need after an eight-miler. The base of the shoe has a textured sole for added traction, making them sturdy enough to wear outdoors. At the same time, they’re flexible for easy packing. Best travel scarf: Elzama Infinity Loop Solid Color Scarf Elzama Infinity Loop Solid Color Scarf Seasoned packers know that scarves aren’t just for style. This scarf upgrades this fashion staple with a discreet zipper pocket that fits small items like a passport, cards, and cash. With 15 colors in an ultra-soft polyester fabric, there’s an option for every travel outfit. Best rain jacket for travel for women: Women’s AKHG Stormwall Rain Jacket Women’s AKHG Stormwall Rain Jacket The AKHG Stormwall Rain Jacket is waterproof, windproof, and breathable. The ripstop nylon fabric won’t snag on branches, and the “Batten Hatch” cuffs help keep the sleeves dry on the inside. Additional features like zippered exterior pockets, internal pockets, pit zips, a three-way adjustable hood, and reflective trim only add to the jacket’s functionality. Best rain jacket for travel for men: Patagonia Men’s Torrentshell 3L Rain Jacket Patagonia Men's Torrentshell 3L Rain Jacket The forecast may call for rain, but you don’t have to change your travel plans as long as you have a good rain jacket. This Patagonia Torrentshell has three layers of water repellency, including a DWR-coated shell. A drawcord hem and an adjustable hood that zips all the way to your chin adds even more protection. Travelers may also appreciate this jacket’s microfleece-lined neck and handwarmer pockets, when rain comes with chilly temps. The best travel accessories for 2025 Back to top Best travel pillow: Cabeau TNE S3 Travel Pillow Cabeau TNE S3 Travel Pillow The Cabeau TNE S3 Travel Pillow is a red-eye game-changer. The strap system attaches to your seat, helping to keep your head from falling forward. The memory foam filling, built-in chin strap, and breathable design contribute to a cozy nap. Best travel wallet: Monos Slim Wallet Monos Slim Wallet With just two pockets inside and one outside, this minimalist bifold forces overpackers to pare down essentials. The smooth vegan leather is made to resist wear and tear, while keeping cards safe. Best travel blanket: EverSnug Travel Blanket EverSnug Travel Blanket A travel blanket may not be necessary for every trip, but they come in handy when you’re stuck at an airport or sleeping in a bare bones hotel bed. This multifunctional EverSnug is lightweight, extra plush, and big enough to cover your body, yet it folds up into a compact (but still fluffy) pillow. Best travel toothbrush: Philips One by Sonicare Battery Toothbrush Philips One by Sonicare Battery Toothbrush The slim, ergonomic design (and included travel case) makes it easy to pack the Philips One by Sonicare Battery Toothbrush, while the tapered bristles help provide a deep clean that’s made to be gentle on gums. We also love the three-month-long battery life. Best travel steamer: Nesugar Steamer Nesugar Steamer No matter how carefully you fold delicates, wrinkly clothes are inevitable while traveling. The Nesugar Steamer is a compact option that heats up in less than 15 seconds and provides continuous steam for up to 10 minutes, says the brand. We love that it’s small enough to fit in a carry-on and light enough to keep your suitcase from tipping over the weight limit. Best travel water bottle: Hydaway Collapsible Water Bottle Hydaway Collapsible Water Bottle This game-changing travel essential is made of flexible, food-grade silicone that folds down to just over an inch when empty, making it easy to pack and store on the go. Plus, it’s dishwasher safe and BPA free. Best travel umbrella: Davek Parasol Davek Parasol According to the company, the fabric on this Davek umbrella is made with a special film that blocks 99 percent of UVA/UVB solar rays. While it’s primarily designed as a sun umbrella, it still comes in handy during an unexpected drizzle. With the fiberglass and aircraft-grade aluminum frame, it’s a lightweight choice for sticking in a backpack or tote. (Rain or shine, be prepared with a sturdy travel umbrella) Best packing cubes for travel: Gonex Compression Packing Cubes Gonex Compression Packing Cubes Every overpacker should invest in a collection of compressible packing cubes. We like this set from Gonex the best because of the built-in handles and elongated shape that lines up with most suitcases for easier packing. No packing cube will magically fit a closet-worth of clothes, but these will help make the most of the space you have. Best travel towel: PackTowl Luxe Quick Dry Microfiber Towel PackTowl Luxe Quick Dry Microfiber Towel Towels like this one can be handy for a variety of trips, not just camping or beach days. The brand says this polyester towel dries 30 percent faster than its cotton counterparts and feels just as soft. It comes in three colors and four sizes (hand to beach) so travelers can be ready for an impromptu swim or sweaty hike. Best power bank for travel: Nitecore NB10000 Gen II Nitecore NB10000 Gen II Power Bank A reliable power bank is likely one of the most important essentials to have in your pack.

2025-01-25T22:10:53.868836,How can tourists participate in conservation efforts while traveling?,"Tourists can participate in conservation efforts while traveling through a range of activities. While visiting protected areas such as those in Panama, they can engage in nature-based tourism experiences like trekking, snorkeling, rock climbing, and birdwatching, all of which can help support local economies and contribute to the preservation of natural habitats. They can also contribute to local conservation efforts by paying park entrance fees and tourism concessions, providing important funding for conservation activities and park maintenance. By spending money in these areas, tourists are also offering a financial incentive for local communities to protect their natural environment. Lastly, through understanding more about the environments they visit, tourists can become activists for conservation, spreading awareness and supporting further protective efforts.","['Tourism in protected areas is a growing economic activity in many countries. By drawing visitors out of tourism hotspots to more remote regions, protected area tourism can bring new benefits to rural communities and indigenous populations.While protected areas provide significant economic value, there tends to be little data to actually back this up. Without reliable and quantifiable evidence, governments and communities may undervalue these natural areas and the benefits they deliver. As a result, important visitor management and conservation activities may be overlooked. Without these types of sustainability measures in place, tourism growth in protected areas can end up harming their fragile environments. \n\n\n\nOur Role \n\n\n\nOne destination focused on developing sustainable tourism in its protected areas is Panama. The country’s 121 protected areas cover over 6.2 million hectares of rainforests, coastal reefs, and other sensitive habitats. An increasing number of visitors come to these areas for nature-based tourism experiences, such as trekking, snorkeling, rock climbing, and birdwatching.In 2017, Sustainable Travel International conducted an economic impact study to determine the value of these natural areas. For this study, our team examined the economic benefits generated by tourism activities within Panama’s protected areas as a way to measure their value.We began by reviewing Panama’s existing tourism data. This included more general statistics such as national visitor arrivals, protected areas statistics, and public use plans.To supplement this data, we collected more specific data on tourism revenues linked to protected areas. \xa0We surveyed businesses in Panama’s protected areas and their surrounding buffer zones. Five protected areas were included in this pilot study: Camino de Cruces National Park, Altos De Campana National Park, La Amistad International Park, Chagres National Park, and Soberanía National Park. Survey participants were asked to provide information about their business, including the services they offer and their revenues.In addition to collecting data from businesses, our team also interviewed visitors to these areas. Through these interviews, we were able to gain a better understanding of who is visiting Panama’s protected areas, what they are doing, and where they are spending their money. \xa0\xa0\xa0The study findings paint a fuller picture of the different groups that are operating in and benefiting from Panama’s protected areas. It also quantifies the economic value of protected area tourism. An added benefit of this research approach is that it provides data not only on impacts at the national level, but also on the value generated for local communities.The real impact of this data lies in its potential to influence destination planning and decision-making. By demonstrating the value of protected areas to the tourism industry, local communities, and the country as a whole, this data helps reinforce the importance of caring for these areas.

By creating jobs, driving infrastructure improvements, and promoting inclusive growth, tourism is a powerful tool to fight poverty and foster community development.With all these benefits, one might assume that local residents would be fully supportive of tourism in their backyards. The problem is that sometimes tourism development has the opposite effect and diminishes local quality of life. Without proper planning, tourism growth can bring about new challenges for locals, such as unaffordable housing prices, dwindling resources, and a loss of cultural authenticity. Over the last year, there’s been increasing global discussion around the issue of “overtourism” and its consequences in more popular destinations, where some communities are literally telling tourists to go home.How then does a destination prevent this situation from happening before it’s too late? It all comes down to finding the balance between tourism growth and local needs.To ensure that tourism enriches local communities, destination managers must pay attention to resident concerns and engage them in development plans. Happy residents play a major part in creating an enjoyable visitor experience and successful tourism industry. When residents win, everyone wins. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOur Role \n\n\n\nThe Caribbean island of St. Kitts is a destination that is well aware of the importance of sustainable, community-driven tourism.\xa0The warm and welcoming Kittitian people are undeniably the heart and soul of the island. The St. Kitts Ministry of Tourism is working to make sure that they are at the heart of tourism as well, by giving them a voice in development.To gauge local attitudes toward tourism, Sustainable Travel International supported the Ministry in administering a resident survey in 2017. This was the first survey of this kind in St. Kitts. Over 320 Kittitians, representing all parishes and demographics completed the survey. \xa0The results examine how well tourism in St. Kitts is meeting local needs, creating opportunities for residents, and impacting their quality of life. A follow-on survey was conducted in 2021 to analyze changes over time and identify opportunities where more can be done to adequately meet resident needs.Understanding resident concerns is the starting point. The next step is taking action to address any existing or potential issues. The Ministry is using the survey findings to guide policy and program interventions, making it a valuable tool for community development.Of course, as tourism grows and the destination changes, residents’ feelings and priorities will change as well. Engaging residents should be an ongoing process. We will continue to support the Ministry to create additional avenues for residents to share their opinions and be involved in decision-making, as well as implement future surveys to monitor changes over time.

Instead of visiting crowded tourist hotspots, travelers can choose to explore more remote regions, thereby bringing economic benefits to rural communities and indigenous populations. Additionally, responsibly developed ecotourism can provide tourists opportunities to interact with local communities, such as local tour guides, local food service providers, or handicraft vendors.

By educating travelers about the ecosystems they visit, ecotourism can also foster environmental stewardship.","['Pack Sustainable: 4 Easy Tips for Lightweight Travel\nConsumption Rules for Sustainable Living: Embracing Minimalism and Eco-Friendly Lifestyle', 'Tourism in protected areas is a growing economic activity in many countries. By drawing visitors out of tourism hotspots to more remote regions, protected area tourism can bring new benefits to rural communities and indigenous populations.While protected areas provide significant economic value, there tends to be little data to actually back this up. Without reliable and quantifiable evidence, governments and communities may undervalue these natural areas and the benefits they deliver. As a result, important visitor management and conservation activities may be overlooked. Without these types of sustainability measures in place, tourism growth in protected areas can end up harming their fragile environments. \n\n\n\nOur Role \n\n\n\nOne destination focused on developing sustainable tourism in its protected areas is Panama. The country’s 121 protected areas cover over 6.2 million hectares of rainforests, coastal reefs, and other sensitive habitats. An increasing number of visitors come to these areas for nature-based tourism experiences, such as trekking, snorkeling, rock climbing, and birdwatching.In 2017, Sustainable Travel International conducted an economic impact study to determine the value of these natural areas. For this study, our team examined the economic benefits generated by tourism activities within Panama’s protected areas as a way to measure their value.We began by reviewing Panama’s existing tourism data. This included more general statistics such as national visitor arrivals, protected areas statistics, and public use plans.To supplement this data, we collected more specific data on tourism revenues linked to protected areas. \xa0We surveyed businesses in Panama’s protected areas and their surrounding buffer zones. Five protected areas were included in this pilot study: Camino de Cruces National Park, Altos De Campana National Park, La Amistad International Park, Chagres National Park, and Soberanía National Park. Survey participants were asked to provide information about their business, including the services they offer and their revenues.In addition to collecting data from businesses, our team also interviewed visitors to these areas. Through these interviews, we were able to gain a better understanding of who is visiting Panama’s protected areas, what they are doing, and where they are spending their money. \xa0\xa0\xa0The study findings paint a fuller picture of the different groups that are operating in and benefiting from Panama’s protected areas. It also quantifies the economic value of protected area tourism. An added benefit of this research approach is that it provides data not only on impacts at the national level, but also on the value generated for local communities.The real impact of this data lies in its potential to influence destination planning and decision-making.

2025-01-25T22:11:01.910976,How to find and support eco-friendly tour operators?,"To find and support eco-friendly tour operators, look for those who are following sustainability standards or who have completed certified sustainable tourism courses. These courses educate key players like policy makers, destination managers, and businesses on sustainable tourism development and management which increases the likelihood of responsible practices.

Another method is to check if the tour operators are part of global initiatives that promote sustainability within the tourism industry. For example, in the case of Panama, Sustainable Travel International worked with local stakeholders to create a sustainability standard for tourism enterprises. 

Additionally, try searching for tour operators that demonstrate efforts to reduce their environmental impact, such as having carbon-neutral policies or other green travel strategies.

Lastly, be wary of greenwashing - the practice of making unsubstantiated or misleading claims about the environmental benefits of a product, service, technology, or company practice. Make sure to do your own research to confirm the company's sustainability claims, looking beyond just their marketing materials. Also consider supporting initiatives that protect vulnerable destinations and empower local communities.","['An online course to foster sustainable tourism development and policy-making in small island developing states \n\n\n\nAs one of the fastest growing sectors in the world, tourism is a key economic factor for many\xa0Small Island Developing States (SIDS).

Reducing your carbon footprint is no longer a “nice-to-have” but a business imperative in Australia. Many organisations have already addressed their Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions from energy use and generation. These scopes are regarded as the low-hanging fruit of emission reductions. Scope 3 emissions on the other hand, emissions sources that included purchased goods and services, events, and travel, have proven more difficult for organisations to manage, especially as they continue to grow. A comprehensive green travel plan isn’t just about reducing your environmental impact; it’s about enhancing your bottom line, improving employee morale, and strengthening your brand reputation.

To accomplish this, Sustainable Travel International\xa0worked with the government and local stakeholders to create\xa0a sustainability standard for Panama’s tourism enterprises.This standard will act as a regulatory framework for hotels, tour guides, land and marine transportation providers, restaurants, tour operators and community-based tourism enterprises. It will allow these tourism providers\xa0to assess their operations and practices in relation to a set of indicators on issues that affect the local environment, communities, and cultural heritage, amongst others. The standard will also serve as the basis for certification and will help travelers identify environmentally-friendly and socially responsible businesses.To ensure that the standard is relevant and feasible within the local context, our field team hosted a series of participatory onsite workshops. During the workshops, over 90 business and government representatives provided input on what practices to evaluate in relation to water and energy conservation, business operations, supply chain management, and environmental protection. Once the final standard was established, we held trainings for the local authorities and auditors responsible for implementing it and confirming business compliance.The sustainability standard has since been included in the national protected area services concessions law – making compliance mandatory for any businesses operating within protected areas.

2025-01-25T22:11:07.865531,What role does sustainable accommodation play in green tourism?,"Sustainable accommodation plays a significant role in green tourism by providing eco-friendly options for travelers. Many sustainable hotels and vacation rentals offer incentives to support eco-travel, such as offering free electric shuttles to the nearest train station or upgrading guests to eco-friendly transportation means. Additionally, these accommodations also advocate for direct booking, reducing the commission typically taken by other booking platforms and ensuring more income goes to the sustainable management of these accommodations. 

Moreover, sustainable accommodations can also provide guests with free e-bike use or special offers to encourage green travel. Many also offer free public transportation passes to encourage guests to move about in a climate-friendly way during their stay. Complimentary e-shuttle services powered by green electricity are also quite common among sustainable accommodations. 

By supporting and encouraging sustainable accommodations, travelers can leave a smaller carbon footprint and promote environmentally friendly practices. Further, they often employ ethical labor practices, conserve resources, and actively engage in nature and species conservation. In essence, sustainable accommodations serve as a cornerstone for green tourism by promoting sustainable practices and offering various initiatives to reduce environmental impacts.","['Want to go on vacation and leave a smaller carbon footprint? Great! Many sustainable hotels and vacation rentals will help you get to your destination by eco-friendly train – for example, with a first-class upgrade or a free electric shuttle to the nearest train station. In this article, we show you the different incentives and support options available through Green Pearls® partner accommodations. Extra tip: Book directly with the hotel and get help with your arrival First, a general tip for green and fair travel: Book your accommodations directly through the hotel’s website. It’s no secret that travel sites like Booking.com take a commission from hotels when you book through them. So while you pay the same room rate, the hotels get less of it. The sustainable accommodations featured in this article are all personally and individually managed and you can contact them directly – you will find links to their websites on the Green PearlsⓇ microsites that we link to here. Our tip for traveling by train: Contact the hotel or vacation rental before you book (by email or phone). Tell them you are booking directly with them, that you are coming by train, and ask if there is anything they can do to help you travel green. Often there are special offers, such as a day of free e-bike use, or you can “beat” a free shuttle ☺️ Especially if you are staying longer, a sustainable accommodation will often meet you halfway. How sustainable accommodations reward and support you when you travel by train Upgrade to first class for the train ride to Zermatt Car-free Zermatt in Switzerland is the perfect destination for a vacation close to nature by train. The Visp-Zermatt line is considered to be a particularly picturesque route through the Swiss picture-book countryside ( like a route of these routes that you can watch on YouTube to relax). The boutique hotel, with a small spa and views of the Matterhorn, is run by the Anthamatten family and is committed to sustainability in all areas (e.g. zero waste principles and regional organic products). Free public transportation pass or guest card Another great offer from eco-friendly hotels are free local transportation passes – so you can get around in a climate-friendly way during your stay. Eco-friendly accommodation and transportation in Freiburg The Green City Hotel Vauban in the beautiful German city of Freiburg im Breisgau is an example of this. The modern city hotel with its green facade is easily accessible by train. Take the train to Freiburg’s main station and from there the number 3 tram to Paula-Modersohn-Platz – the stop is right in front of the hotel. Green PearlsⓇ hotels on the Ritten in South Tyrol offer you the RittenCard The Ritten Plateau in South Tyrol is a popular destination for an active vacation in the Italian Alps. You won’t need a car here, as the entire region is exemplary in its commitment to environmentally friendly transportation. The RittenCard gives you free use of all local transport, including the historic mountain railway and the cable car to Bolzano, as well as free entry to some 90 museums, exhibitions and attractions. “Thanks to our Green Mobility service, the car is a distant memory,” reports the ADLER Lodge RITTEN*. Here you also receive a RittenCard, as well as the possibility to rent e-bikes and hire experienced guides to accompany you on hikes or e-bike tours. Arrival: From the Bolzano train station it is a 5 minute walk to the Renon cable car. The cable car leaves every 4 minutes and takes you to Soprabolzano in 12 minutes. Once there, a shuttle from ADLER Lodge RITTEN will be waiting for you. The RittenCard is also included in the room price at the APIPURA hotel rinner and will be sent to you before you arrive. You can also reach the hotel from Bolzano with the Ritten cable car and from Oberbozen with the Ritten train – the “Rinner” stop is right in front of the hotel! If you are a bee lover, you will love the APIPURA hotel rinner: the hotel has its own organic apiary, there is a bee nature trail and organic honey is served daily at the breakfast buffet. Eco-friendly hiking vacation in the Hohe Tauern National Park with a guest card East Tyrol also has a guest card that allows you to use public transportation and offers free or a discount at many attractions. You receive one as a guest at the family-run Naturhotel Outside in Matrei. The hotel is an official hiking hotel with a hiking concierge and also offers a free shuttle from Lienz train station (there and back). A shuttle from Kitzbühel train station is available for a fee. Complimentary e-Shuttle service powered by green electricity If you travel by train, you are already traveling in a pretty environmentally friendly way. Now imagine being picked up at the station by an e-shuttle powered by the hotel’s green electricity – pretty green and convenient, isn’t it? This is possible at the Hotel Das Rübezahl in Füssen (the train station is also located here). And once you are there, the best way to explore the picturesque Allgäu region with its panoramic view of Neuschwanstein Castle is on foot. Hiking concierge Bergbaschdi will be happy to assist you. The Birkenhof***** Spa & Genussresort Hotel in the Upper Palatinate Lake District will pick you up at Schwandorf train station with its own electric shuttle. The hotel includes a large spa area with several saunas and pools, as well as the 2-star restaurant Obendorfers Eisvogel – you’ll find it hard to find a reason to leave the premises 🙂 At the Hotel Klosterbräu in Tyrol, you can order the hotel’s “Green Shuttle” (an electric Viano bus) for free throughout the Seefeld area. The Seefeld ICE train station is only 200 meters from the hotel, so you can easily walk there. However, the shuttle is worthwhile if you have heavy or bulky luggage, such as ski equipment or the like. The sustainable hotel complex within the old monastery walls offers a wide range of services, including wellness, its own brewery, yoga classes, a petting zoo and child care. “The electric vehicle is a highlight for our guests,” reports the CERVO Mountain Resort in Zermatt. As mentioned above, the village of Zermatt is car-free, and apart from the electric vehicles, only horse-drawn carriages are allowed. The CERVO consists of several wooden chalets and has an award-winning design style. Rail and Hotel: More eco-friendly hotels with shuttle services in Europe To stay within the scope of this article, we will give you a brief overview of even more sustainable European hotels with shuttle services: Germany Austria Italy Eco-hotels in Paris and Milan Of course, city hotels in European metropolises are ideal for combining train and eco-hotel. “Paris has 6 train stations, and depending on which direction guests are coming from, they arrive at the appropriate station. From Germany, it is Gare de L’Est and Gare du Nord,” says Barbara Tascijevic-Porwoll of the Green Spirit Hotels. The Amelie, Malar and Le Pavilion hotels are all in the 7th arrondissement, within walking distance of the Eiffel Tower. By the way, Paris has done a lot to become more bike-friendly and has created many new bike paths! Of course, there is also the famous metro, which is an environmentally friendly way to get from A to B. The marbled Milan Central Station is also accessible from all over Europe with direct lines. Here, in the heart of the city, lies the Hotel Milano Scala, Italy’s first zero-emissions hotel. All electricity is generated by geothermal probes. From the train station to the hotel by bus, bike, or on foot For our more rural partners, traveling by train is not quite as easy – but no less appealing for it. “We recommend that you take your bike with you when you arrive by train. And then cycle the rest of the way from Eystrup or Nienburg station to us,” explain the host sisters at Hotel Okelmann’s in Warpe. The train stations are about 20 kilometers away and can be reached from Bremen or Hannover. There is also a lot to discover in the area by bike. The Okelmanns’ father is an enthusiastic cyclist himself and has entered several routes in komoot. The Gut Guntrams in Austria can be reached from Vienna’s Pitten train station. From there, it is a 25-minute walk along a forest nature trail to Guntramsburg. The hotel’s website offers a beautifully designed map of the trail, complete with photos and arrows. First by train, then by bus The Pfunds in Tirol bus stop is just one minute from the Summit Lodges Pfunds, so you can catch the bus right outside your vacation home. The spacious log cabin has its own sauna and fireplace! During the winter there is also a ski bus to the ski area. The nearest train station is Landeck-Zams. To get to the Naturresort Gerbehof by train, you must first get to the train station in Friedrichshafen on Lake Constance. The station is 5 kilometers from the resort and there are buses to Ailingen every 15 minutes. The walk from Ailingen bus station to Gerbehof is 1.2 kilometers. A little exercise in nature never hurts anyone, as they say! Alternatively, you can always take a taxi from the station to your accommodation. Either way, you are traveling in a climate-friendly way and keeping your carbon footprint small. Both by traveling and by choosing your accommodation. You may even find that you enjoy traveling by public transportation or bicycle and use them more at home. *CIN-Codes: IT021011A1AE4737IT (My Arbor), IT008010A1NIWKHTTF (Relais del Maro), IT021072A1L46PNBHX (Hotel Weihrerhof), IT021072A1UOWUIDH4 (APIPURA hotel rinner), IT021072A1QCJQTLUQ (ADLER Lodge RITTEN) Save the article for your next travel plans and arrival by train.', 'On our blog we often talk about HOW to travel sustainable. Today, though, we want to talk about WHY it is important. We’ll give away this much: it’s not just about protecting the environment. Ultimately, sustainable travel benefits you personally. #1 Tourism as an economic factor The tourism industry is an important economic factor – in some countries it is the most important. Your vacation sets your money in motion, helping to redistribute wealth and pay workers. Hotels are often large businesses with many employees, subcontractors, suppliers, etc. who also benefit from a financially successful hotel. Unfortunately, not all hotels are sustainable and socially responsible, and often your money does not benefit your vacation destination at all. You may travel to a hotel in Thailand and your money ends up with an investor in the US or Japan. Some hotels employ seasonal workers who live in shabby accommodations (I was told this for a German island, for example). By consciously choosing a hotel that operates in a sustainable and usually fair manner, you ensure that your money really benefits the region and creates fair jobs. Support fair labor practices in hotels One example is the Green City Hotel Vauban in Freiburg, Germany. This sustainable city hotel is an integration project, and half of all employees are people with physical and/or mental disabilities. The hotel has deep roots in Freiburg. Its shareholders are the Vereinigung Freiburger Sozialarbeit e.V. and the Freiburger Stadtbau GmbH. Even abroad, you have many opportunities to use your purchasing power to help other people (instead of supporting their exploitation). At our Green PearlsⓇ partner Farmhouse Smiling Gecko in Cambodia, the luxury resort ensures the financing of the Smiling Gecko NGO’s training centers, school and organic farm, and also serves as a training center and employer itself. #2 preserving resources You probably already know this: Planet B does not exist. The idea that we could someday completely deplete our planet of all its resources, destroy all animal and plant species (and perhaps even entire populations), and live on Mars from then on is NOT realistic! Fossil resources such as oil, coal and natural gas are finite. This means that they are taken from the Earth and then they are gone. Theoretically, these resources will eventually reform, but in the case of oil, for example, it takes at least 10,000 years for new oil to form from dead plant matter and plankton. We should all be aware that what we consume today will not be available to our children, grandchildren, great-grandchildren and future generations. Renewable energy in the hospitality industry In our opinion, one of the requirements for a sustainable hotel is to run on renewable energy. The least you can do is get 100% green electricity (something you can easily do at home by simply switching your electricity provider). But many hotels go further. For example, our partner Hotel Milano Scala was the first Zero Emission Hotel in Italy. It is powered by geothermal energy, a renewable energy source that “significantly reduces greenhouse gas emissions,” according to the Ministry of the Environment, Climate and Energy. Other hotels and residences rely on their own combined heat and power plants, heat pump technologies, photovoltaic and solar thermal systems, and heat recovery measures to reduce their own consumption of fossil resources while minimizing CO2 emissions. Upcycling and organic Conserving resources is not only about energy, but also about buildings and furnishings. The HUBERTUS Mountain Refugio Allgäu recently renovated its hotel rooms using a sustainable upcycling concept. Instead of buying new furniture, the existing solid wood furniture in the rooms was simply dismantled, the (outdated) decorations removed and the furniture reworked. The new composition created modern furniture without cutting down any trees! (You can learn more about this in this YouTube video by owner Marc Traubel and interior designer Sarah Stapelfeld) Throughout Biohotel Grafenast you will find sustainable and natural materials such as solid wood and local stone. The eco-friendly hotel is also committed to organic farming and uses only organic food – whenever possible, directly from the region and from the hotel’s own “Sehnsuchtsgarten” (garden of longing). Short delivery distances mean fewer greenhouse gases, and the absence of pesticides helps preserve biodiversity. #3 Promote nature and species conservation Which brings us to the next argument: sustainable travel supports conservation. Take, for example, the Casa León Royal Retreat in Gran Canaria. This small boutique hotel in the interior of the island has created a garden of native plants on its 10,000-square-meter property and uses only natural pest control. Here you can see a variety of small animals, such as the Canary Island bullfinch – the original form of the domesticated canary! The hotel uses a rainwater cistern system for irrigation. In another sustainable initiative, the family that owns Casa León Royal Retreat has leased a 40,000-square-foot piece of forest in the Balkans that is maintained but still largely untouched. This has created another protected area for animals and plants in this world, which also helps the climate. #4 Experience the country and its people in an authentic way Sustainable travel means going off the beaten track and visiting places away from the usual mass tourism destinations. This gives you a real opportunity to experience the country you are visiting and get to know the locals. Albergi Diffusi is saving villages in Italy In Italy, the Albergo Diffuso movement has helped save Italian villages from decay. An Albergo Diffuso is a hotel spread over several buildings in a village. You live among the locals. Our Green PearlsⓇ partner Relais del Maro is a prime example. Owner Elena Scalambrin converted several of her family’s commercial and residential buildings into a 4-star hotel. Guests arrive at the main house with a reception for dinner (and the pool), but otherwise stay in lovingly decorated rooms in the middle of the village community. The hotel has helped keep the village bakery and other local businesses alive. Here you will be able to experience the real Liguria and see the positive effects of sustainable tourism at first hand. #5 Learning to love nature “In the end, we will conserve only what we love” – Baba Dioum, Senegalese forestry engineer and conservationist It is easy to understand Baba Dioum’s famous quote, delivered at a biodiversity conference in India in 1968. As we showed in our blog post on insect extinction, many animals and plants simply do not have a strong “lobby”. We think of some bugs and algae as expendable. It is only when we understand the important role they play that we learn to love them and work to conserve them. Guided hikes in the Allgäu At Hotel Das Rübezahl in Füssen, you have the opportunity to discover nature with the hotel’s own hiking guide. “Bergbaschdi” will take you into the mountains and show you the flora and fauna. You are sure to discover things you would otherwise have missed. (Read more in our interview with the hiking concierge) Experience glaciers live in Switzerland Glaciers are also very interesting. These “eternal” masses of ice are the largest reservoirs of fresh water on our planet, and they are in danger of disappearing! Fabienne Anthamatten of the Hotel Bella Vista Zermatt can tell you all about it. Her hotel has an 8,000-year-old larch tree that she found on a former glacier field. This means that the trunk was preserved in the ice for several thousand years and has now been uncovered. On a trip to the glaciers, you can admire the fascinating masses of ice (there are still many kilometers left) and better understand the connections to global warming. #6 Have a vision – and think about the future Just being in the present moment is a beautiful mindfulness exercise. But you should also have a vision in your life. A vision is a motivating, positive idea about the future. And that’s what sustainable travel is all about. According to the UN, sustainable tourism is: “Tourism that takes full account of its current and future economic, social and environmental impacts.” So it’s thinking about the NOW as well as the FUTURE and taking responsibility for it. If you can do that, you’re doing pretty well. And what better way to learn how to do that and develop your own vision of the future than to travel the world sustainably and be inspired by other visionaries?

2025-01-25T22:11:15.724480,How can travelers support sustainable wildlife tourism?,"Travelers can support sustainable wildlife tourism in various ways:

1. Visiting Protected Areas: Protected areas are often biodiversity hotspots that are economically valuable. By visiting these areas, travelers can contribute to the economy and help prove the value of these regions, encouraging their continued protection and management.

2. Participate in Eco-Tourism: Responsible eco-tourism stimulates local economies and can combat rural poverty. By partaking in ecotourism, travelers provide income that can be channeled into conservation activities and park maintenance. 

3. Supporting Local Businesses and Communities: This can range from hiring local tour guides to purchasing local goods and food. In doing so, travelers can help to create alternative livelihoods for rural and indigenous communities around protected areas.

4. Paying Entrance Fees and Concessions: These revenues often support conservation efforts and park maintenance.

5. Education: Learn about the ecosystems visited and their role in environmental stewardship. This increased understanding can foster support for conservation efforts.

6. Opt for Sustainable Wildlife Activities: Choosing wildlife experiences that are sustainable and ethical ensures that tourism does not harm sensitive wildlife and their habitats.

7. Promoting Sustainable Travel: Travelers can use their voice to promote responsible tourism among friends, family, and on social media, helping to increase the overall demand for sustainable wildlife tourism. 

Lastly, an overarching principle is to respect the environment and wildlife, and follow any given guidelines or rules to minimize disturbance to these sensitive areas.","['Tourism in protected areas is a growing economic activity in many countries. By drawing visitors out of tourism hotspots to more remote regions, protected area tourism can bring new benefits to rural communities and indigenous populations.While protected areas provide significant economic value, there tends to be little data to actually back this up. Without reliable and quantifiable evidence, governments and communities may undervalue these natural areas and the benefits they deliver. As a result, important visitor management and conservation activities may be overlooked. Without these types of sustainability measures in place, tourism growth in protected areas can end up harming their fragile environments. \n\n\n\nOur Role \n\n\n\nOne destination focused on developing sustainable tourism in its protected areas is Panama. The country’s 121 protected areas cover over 6.2 million hectares of rainforests, coastal reefs, and other sensitive habitats. An increasing number of visitors come to these areas for nature-based tourism experiences, such as trekking, snorkeling, rock climbing, and birdwatching.In 2017, Sustainable Travel International conducted an economic impact study to determine the value of these natural areas. For this study, our team examined the economic benefits generated by tourism activities within Panama’s protected areas as a way to measure their value.We began by reviewing Panama’s existing tourism data. This included more general statistics such as national visitor arrivals, protected areas statistics, and public use plans.To supplement this data, we collected more specific data on tourism revenues linked to protected areas. \xa0We surveyed businesses in Panama’s protected areas and their surrounding buffer zones. Five protected areas were included in this pilot study: Camino de Cruces National Park, Altos De Campana National Park, La Amistad International Park, Chagres National Park, and Soberanía National Park. Survey participants were asked to provide information about their business, including the services they offer and their revenues.In addition to collecting data from businesses, our team also interviewed visitors to these areas. Through these interviews, we were able to gain a better understanding of who is visiting Panama’s protected areas, what they are doing, and where they are spending their money. \xa0\xa0\xa0The study findings paint a fuller picture of the different groups that are operating in and benefiting from Panama’s protected areas. It also quantifies the economic value of protected area tourism. An added benefit of this research approach is that it provides data not only on impacts at the national level, but also on the value generated for local communities.The real impact of this data lies in its potential to influence destination planning and decision-making. By demonstrating the value of protected areas to the tourism industry, local communities, and the country as a whole, this data helps reinforce the importance of caring for these areas. We hope this data incentivizes improved conservation and leads to better visitor management in protected areas.Header Photo Credit: Billtacular via\xa0Flickr \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProject Type \n\n\n\nDestination: Panama \n\n\n\nRegion: Central America \n\n\n\nLocation \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDates\n \n\n\n\n2017 \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOur Partners \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExplore More Destination Projects \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNet Zero Training for Barbados\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAssessing the Carrying Capacity of\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSt. Kitts Destination Guardians\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPalau: Carbon Neutral Tourism Destination\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDeveloping Sustainable Tourism Initiatives in\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMonitoring Lenga Tree Reforestation in\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSustainable Tourism Course for Small\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInvesting in the Development of\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSustainable Tourism Enterprise Program for\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMesoamerican Reef Tourism Initiative (MARTI)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKawésqar Community Tourism & Empowerment\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRestoring the Base Torres Trail\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProtect the Places You Love \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHelp conserve our planet’s most vulnerable destinations and empower the people who live there.

However, until recently, Panama had not actively developed or promoted tourism in its parks, protected areas, and more rural areas. Sustainable Travel International partnered with the Republic of Panama Government to use this opportunity for tourism development as a means to increase conservation and create benefits for local communities. \n\n\n\nBenefits of Ecotourism \n\n\n\nRural and Indigenous Communities \n\n\n\nIn Panama and elsewhere, responsibly developed ecotourism holds the potential to stimulate local economies, benefit indigenous communities, and combat rural poverty. By creating alternative livelihoods for communities in and around protected areas, ecotourism presents an opportunity for indigenous people support themselves and their families as tour guides, food service providers, or handicraft vendors. \n\n\n\nBiodiversity and Conservation \n\n\n\nBecause tourism often flourishes in biodiversity hotspots, ecotourism also has the unique ability to contribute to the protection of some of the earth’s most valuable natural areas and ecosystems. The revenues from park entrance fees and tourism concessions provide added funding that can be channeled into conservation activities and park maintenance. In addition, the income generated by ecotourism provides an economic incentive for local people to protect the natural environment so that it remains a valuable tourism asset. By educating travelers on the ecosystems they visit and their role in environmental stewardship, ecotourism can also increase traveler activism and support of conservation. \n\n\n\nOur Role \n\n\n\nIn\xa02015 and 2016, our team worked with local stakeholders to analyze regional opportunities and challenges and map out a\xa0country-wide action plan\xa0for developing ecotourism in Panama’s protected areas. The resulting plan includes specific strategies for developing ecotourism in a manner that will enhance protection of Panama’s sensitive habitats and wildlife, promote inclusion of rural and indigenous communities and local culture, and foster capacity building and skills development. In March 2016, the Government of Panama and private sector officially adopted the plan and implementation is already underway. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLocation \n\n\n\nDestination: Panama \n\n\n\nRegion: Central America \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDates\n \n\n\n\n2015-2016 \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOur Partners \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExplore More Destination Projects \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNet Zero Training for Barbados\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAssessing the Carrying Capacity of\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSt. Kitts Destination Guardians\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPalau: Carbon Neutral Tourism Destination\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDeveloping Sustainable Tourism Initiatives in\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMonitoring Lenga Tree Reforestation in\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSustainable Tourism Course for Small\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInvesting in the Development of\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSustainable Tourism Enterprise Program for\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMesoamerican Reef Tourism Initiative (MARTI)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKawésqar Community Tourism & Empowerment\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRestoring the Base Torres Trail\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProtect the Places You Love \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHelp conserve our planet’s most vulnerable destinations and empower the people who live there.

2025-01-25T22:11:24.586970,What are best practices for sustainable beach and coastal tourism?,"Best practices for sustainable beach and coastal tourism in small island developing states (SIDS) as discussed in the information provided include:

1. Strategic Planning: It is necessary to plan tourism development that takes into account the needs of the local economy, environment, and host communities. 

2. Collaboration: Collaboration is needed among stakeholder groups for the sustainable development of the tourism.

3. Well-Formulated Policies and Standards: Development should establish well-formulated policies and standards that address the shared challenges and promote the sustainable development of tourism in SIDS.

4. Responsible Tourism: Tourists and businesses should practice responsible travel to minimize environmental damage. This includes economic use of water and electricity, avoiding waste and plastic, and supporting climate-friendly policies and projects.

5. Local Engagement: Engaging with local communities is important to foster understanding and respect for the local culture, and to ensure that tourism benefits local inhabitants.

6. Preservation and Conservation: Initiatives to preserve the environment and natural resources should be supported, such as clean-up operations, building sea walls, promoting renewable energy, marine life protection, and coral conservation projects.

7. Sustainable Waste Management: Waste management is a key issue in many tourist locations, and addressing it should be a top priority to maintain the environment for both inhabitants and travelers. 

8. Sustainable Tourism Standards: Creating and implementing a set of guidelines for tourism sector providers will help ensure tourism activities are safe, environmentally responsible, and beneficial for the local communities.

9. Community Involvement: Establish platforms in each local community (bario) for participation in tourism-related planning and decision-making. This will increase resident pride and awareness of their role in the tourism value chain.

10. Education: Tourists, policy-makers, destination managers, and local communities should be educated about sustainable tourism.","['An online course to foster sustainable tourism development and policy-making in small island developing states \n\n\n\nAs one of the fastest growing sectors in the world, tourism is a key economic factor for many\xa0Small Island Developing States (SIDS). However, the size and geographic location of SIDS results in many vulnerabilities that limit their competitiveness in the industry. Additionally, unplanned tourism growth can present many risks for their ecosystems and inhabitants.Because of this, it is critical to ensure that tourism development in SIDS occurs in a sustainable manner that accounts for the needs of the local economy, environment, and host communities. Accomplishing this requires strategic planning, collaboration across stakeholder groups, and well-formulated policies and standards.\xa0Policy-makers and destination managers are some of the key groups who play a pivotal role in leading and fostering the sustainable development of the tourism in SIDS. \n\n\n\nOur Role \n\n\n\nTo address this need and guide small island destinations towards more a sustainable future, we developed a sustainable tourism course specifically geared towards policy-makers and destination managers in SIDS. This course is being offered as an open online course in partnership with the Hamburg University of Applied Sciences and the Hamburg Open Online University (HOOU). The course is currently underway with nearly 500 students enrolled and a group of expert tutors guiding learners along the way.The course aims to address the shared challenges and promote the sustainable development of tourism in SIDS by:Enhancing participant understanding of sustainable tourism development and managementInspiring learners to think carefully and critically about current SIDS’ tourism issues and related tourism policiesEnabling participants to assess the opportunities that sustainable tourism strategies offer for SIDS in particularIncreasing participant understanding of how policy-making can improve tourism in small island statesBy bringing together a diverse group of learners and incorporating concrete examples from around the world, the course seeks to form a global SIDS learning community and foster cross-destination collaboration around sustainable tourism in small island states. \n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProtect the Places You Love \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHelp conserve our planet’s most vulnerable destinations and empower the people who live there.

But the islands are threatened by environmental damage and rising sea levels. But simply avoiding the popular vacation destination will not solve the problem – tourism not only provides a livelihood for the majority of the island’s inhabitants, it also helps fund preservation projects. Here we introduce you to the Maldives and show you what a sustainable vacation in the Maldives can look like. In addition, we will introduce you to Gili Lankanfushi Eco Resort and other sustainable initiatives and projects. The Maldives are in danger! The Maldives consists of 26 atolls with nearly 1,200 coral islands. The capital, Male, one of the highest points in the archipelago, is only 2.40 meters above sea level. The islands are threatened for several reasons: As you can see, the problems of the Maldives are closely linked to climate change. So the most important thing you can do for the Maldives (even from home) is to live a generally sustainable life, keep your carbon footprint low, avoid waste and plastic, and support climate-friendly policies and projects. Can a holiday in the Maldives be sustainable? This question is probably asked by everyone who thinks about a trip to the Maldives. A long-haul flight to the islands in the Indian Ocean is an ecological problem. According to the German Federal Environment Agency, a flight from Germany to the Maldives and back has a “climate impact of about three tons of CO2 equivalents”. (This is the equivalent of driving a mid-range car about 15,000 kilometers). Nevertheless, we believe that travel to the Maldives should not be demonized. Tourism is very important for the country. It is the main source of income. According to GIZ, the Maldives receives 90 percent of all tax and customs revenue from tourism. The money helps to clean the beaches of marine debris, build sea walls, promote renewable energy, etc. Therefore, not traveling to the Maldives, or even banning travel to the Maldives, is not the answer. Instead, we advocate making a conscious decision to travel to the Maldives, addressing your impact as a tourist, and making your trip sustainable. We will show you how to do this using Gili Lankanfushi as an example. Sustainable Maldives Vacation at Gili Lankanfushi The sustainable luxury resort of Gili Lankanfushi consists of 45 eco-villas on the water and is committed to environmental protection (no disposable products, economical use of water and electricity) as well as social projects. These include purchasing local products, training staff, and supporting a school. Maldives: A strong commitment to marine life In addition to this commitment to everyday hotel life, there are many exciting environmental projects initiated and supported by the hotel. With Gili Veshi, Gili Lankanfushi has opened a marine biology center that promotes research and gives you the opportunity to get involved: Here you can participate\xa0in monthly coral reef clean-ups, help with seagrass planting, or assist with coral colonization. If you want to learn more about Gili Lankanfushi’s sustainable diving projects, we already wrote about them on this blog article about sustainable diving vacation. Close encounters with the greats of the sea A special feature of the Maldives: With a bit of luck, even snorkelers can get close to whale sharks – at up to 13 meters in length, they are the largest sharks in the world – or be surrounded by majestic manta rays. One of the most famous sighting spots is Hanifaru Bay in Baa Atoll. During the western monsoon from May to November, plankton collects in the funnel-shaped lagoon and magically attracts the animals. Up to 200 manta rays and 20 whale sharks have been spotted here simultaneously! To protect the animals, resorts and dive centers in Baa Atoll have joined forces with the NGO BAARU, which sorts and disposes of marine debris. Sustainable vacations in the Maldives: take action for the corals yourself Without coral, the Maldives would not exist, as the islands are part of atolls, ring-shaped coral reefs. Only healthy reefs can help counteract the effects of rising sea levels and the sinking of islands into the sea. However, the effects of climate change and heavy pollution have already destroyed a large part of the reefs. As a result, some resorts are working on specific projects to help corals recover. At Gili Lankanfushi, you can watch marine biologists grow new corals and learn about these special creatures at regular lectures. As a scuba diver, you can also get involved underwater, for example by cleaning the Coral Lines. Get to know the country and its people Most travelers do not know how people live in the Maldives. This is not due to the ignorance of the diving and swimming tourists (as one might think), but is a political decision. Since the Islamic country opened up to tourism in 1972, a clear distinction has been made between islands for tourists and islands for locals. Contrary to what is often assumed in the West, Islam itself is a very tolerant religion. The motto is “Lakum Dinakum, wa lia Din” (for you your religion/way of life, for us our religion/way of life). This means that you can enter the Maldives as an unmarried couple, sunbathe in a bikini, drink alcohol, etc. Originally, tourists were not allowed on native islands, and natives were not allowed on tourist islands, except as workers. This has since been liberalized. Gili Lankanfushi is located in the North Malé Atoll. If you want to meet the locals, you can either go to the capital Male or take a boat trip to Dhiffuhi Island. About 1,000 people live here. There are three mosques, two schools, shops, cafes, a hospital, farming and fishing. Alcohol is forbidden here and although there is no legal dress code, you should dress more modestly out of respect (Men: shorts up to the knees, women: shoulders, neckline and knees covered). A sustainable vacation in the Maldives is not just a nice-to-have Luxury, palm trees, white beaches and a turquoise sea are the hallmarks of the Maldives. But this image is being threatened by unscrupulous tourism and reckless travel decisions. Sustainable travel to the Maldives (and other island paradises) is an absolute must. So if you decide to travel to the Maldives, plan a longer stay and get involved in a country that definitely has too much to offer for you to just visit the beach in front of your hotel 😉 .

While just over 100,000 people call the island ‘home’, these inhabitants are by no means the only people you’ll find on the island. Though Aruba may be small, its allure is mighty. \xa0The constant sunshine, long stretches of white-sand beaches, and cool trade winds attract millions of visitors to Aruba’s shores year after year. In 2015, over 1.8 million people visited the island and took part in activities such as diving, kite-surfing, and exploring the desert-like hills of Arikok National Park.Given the small size of the island and the limited availability of natural resources, local stakeholders felt a need to determine how the tourism industry could more positively impact the environment and local community. With the aim of encouraging greater collaboration and planning around sustainable destination management, Aruba joined the\xa0Sustainable Destinations Alliance for the Americas (SDAA)\xa0in 2016. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\xa0Eagle Beach by\xa0Chris Ford\xa0/ flickr; Arikok National Park by\xa0Christina Leigh Morgan\xa0/ flickr; Tourists in downtown Oranjestad by\xa0Roberto Maldeno\xa0/ flickr \n\n\n\nIdentifying the issues and taking action \n\n\n\nWe began our work in Aruba last year with an initial onsite diagnostic in October 2016. During this first visit, we had the opportunity to meet with over 50 stakeholders from the government, businesses, and local community. By listening to their insights and seeing the island’s key tourism sites in-person, we were able to gain a better understanding of the current sustainability status of Aruba’s tourism industry. At the start of the new year, we returned to Aruba for a second time to share the diagnostic results with local stakeholders and to help them outline the next steps they’d like to take.Over 35 stakeholders, including representatives from the Aruba Tourism Authority, local hotels and tour operators, and other government entities, gathered for the workshop we hosted in Oranjestad. We began the workshop by presenting the diagnostic results. Remember how we said\xa0over 1.8 MILLION\xa0tourists came to Aruba? While these millions of tourists were exploring the island and pumping their dollars into the local economy, they also used energy, created waste and used thousands of liters of drinking water. The results of the diagnostic highlighted the different sustainability issues that we discovered within the tourism industry in Aruba. \xa0Some of these issues were inefficient waste management, poor visitor management and monitoring, and low community involvement within the industry.Following the presentation of the results, we facilitated a discussion and action-planning activity. When asked which of the sustainability issues were the most important to them, there was resounding agreement among the attendees that dealing with the island’s waste should be one of the top priorities. Waste is a major problem affecting the island, especially since the current landfill is reaching its limit. One issue attendees cited was the occasional waste burning that occurs in the landfill. This causes air pollution and poses an environmental and health risk. Not only does the lack of a sustainable waste model waste negatively affect the visitor experience, but it also harms the island’s marine life and affects the quality of life of Aruba’s residents.Participants were then tasked with coming up for ideas about what action should be taken to address the waste issue. They discussed the pros and cons of having an incinerator, converting the waste into gas so that this energy could be used, and increasing recycling capacity. All of these options need careful analysis and the involvement of other players, so these will be the next steps to ensure that Aruba manages its waste in an appropriate manner. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLocal destination stakeholders attended an action planning workshop in January 2017 \n\n\n\n\nPriority Action Projects \n\n\n\nIn addition to the sustainable waste processing project, the participants identified three additional priority action projects during the workshop:\xa0 \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\nDevelopment of sustainability tourism standards: This project involves designing and implementing a set of guidelines for tourism sector providers including tour operators, restaurants, accommodation, tour guides, and transport providers. The creation of these standards will help ensure that tourism activities are performed in a manner that is safe, environmentally responsible, respectful of heritage and beneficial for the local communities.      \t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\nCreation of a formal watchdog platform for the Destination Development Plan/SDAA actions: This project will establish a multi-stakeholder destination stewardship council that will enforce existing laws and policies as well as oversee the long-term implementation of the destination action plan. This watchdog platform will help to protect Aruba’s natural and cultural resources by improving the management of tourism sites and mitigating negative tourism impacts.   \t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n‘Bario Boost: Mi Dushi Bario’: This project will set up participatory platforms in each bario (neighborhood) that will give communities the opportunity to take part in tourism-related planning and decision-making. These platforms will also help to increase resident pride and awareness of their role in the tourism value chain.\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhile these changes won’t happen overnight; the progress that destination stakeholders have made so far in developing an action plan is undoubtedly a step in the right direction. We look forward to continuing our work with Aruba and helping them make this vision a reality. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLearn more about the Sustainable Destinations Alliance for the Americas \n\n\n\n\n\n\nLearn more']","{'qa_similarity': 0.7828150391578674, 'context_relevance': 0.744670569896698, 'answer_length': 284, 'has_structure': False}"
