Net Zero Training for Barbados Tourism Businesses,"This training program for Barbados’s tourism industry focused on reducing tourism’s carbon footprint on the island and building capacity to adapt to climate change. 



Barbados is a small island in the Caribbean that relies on tourism for a large portion of its income. Many Bajans own their own tourism companies, and countless others work for larger hospitality corporations. Tourism supports 33% of the country’s jobs, making it a vital source of income for many residents. The island relies on its pristine beaches, sprawling coral reefs, and natural beauty to attract visitors. Protecting these areas is essential to the country’s social and economic well-being. Climate change brings a new set of challenges and threats that make the need for sustainable tourism more present than ever. As climate change accelerates, small islands like Barbados are extremely vulnerable to its effects, such as rising sea levels and intense tropical storms. Worsening storms cause destruction and make it difficult to transport goods, jeopardizing food security during hurricane season due to the island’s reliance on imported foods. The changing climate exacerbates the influx of sargassum, a seaweed that washes up on beaches in large quantities and negatively impacts the tourist experience. Warmer temperatures also contribute to more frequent droughts, making freshwater a precious resource in Barbados. Natural ecosystems are crucial in mitigating the impacts of climate change, but these resources have been severely depleted in Barbados. Many of the mangroves that once protected the island’s coastline from storm surges and flooding were removed for tourism development, unintentionally diminishing nature’s power to reduce damage. Likewise, nearly all of the island’s tropical forests were cut down in the 15th century to make way for sugar plantations. The loss of these ecosystems leaves the island susceptible and reduces its capacity to absorb climate-warming emissions from the atmosphere. As global carbon emissions continue to rise, Barbados is not standing idly by. In 2019, Prime Minister Mottley declared that Barbados would implement a national strategy to become carbon neutral by 2030. This includes planting 1 million trees and implementing a plan to foster food security and climate change resilience. Since tourism is a vital economic driver in Barbados, enhancing the industry’s sustainability is essential to country-wide climate action. The tourism industry must lower its carbon footprint and support initiatives like agroforestry that increase climate resilience. This begins with providing local tourism professionals with the knowledge, tools, and inspiration they need to reduce their environmental impact. 



Our Role 



In 2022, we partnered with the Barbados Tourism Marketing Incorporated (BTMI) to offer a Net Zero Training for the local tourism industry. Attendees included a range of tourism professionals from hoteliers to transportation providers to attractions. This full-day workshop educated participants about the importance of climate-conscious travel and how they can contribute to climate mitigation and adaptation in the tourism sector. Through a combination of informational presentations, group discussions, interactive exercises, and a field trip, participants learned about:The impacts of climate change on small island destinations, including real-life examples from BarbadosThe growing demand for climate-friendly travel experiencesHow travel contributes to climate change and an overview of Sustainable Travel International’s proprietary carbon measurement tools for hotels, restaurants, and tour operatorsSteps on how to reduce the carbon footprint of their business and incorporate adaptation measures to minimize the risks of climate changeThe importance of climate financing, including what carbon offsets are During the workshop, guest speakers shared some of the climate initiatives taking place on the island. For instance, participants learned about a local agrotourism project that is restoring Barbados’s forest cover, increasing its carbon sinks, and boosting local food production. They also heard how sargassum is being safely removed from coastlines and repurposed into plastic alternatives and biofuels, and about a local company that produces drinking water from the air using solar energy.Participants embarked on field trips to a tourism adventure park, an electric vehicle supplier facility, and an agrotourism project. During these outings, participants witnessed some of Barbados’s climate-friendly practices in person. At the adventure park, participants saw the attraction’s fleet of electric vehicles, water harvesting practices, composting facility, and native plant greenhouse. At the EV facility, participants learned about electric vehicle infrastructure in Barbados. These field trips allowed participants to connect with some of Barbados’s most innovative initiatives and see how they can get involved. This training was just the beginning of Barbados’s climate journey.

Assessing the Carrying Capacity of the Seychelles Islands,"Building a roadmap for low-impact, high-value tourism that preserves the beauty and ecosystems of Seychelles while developing sustainable infrastructure and boosting the economy. 



The 115 islands of Seychelles form an archipelago in the Indian Ocean. Boasting world renowned natural heritage, pristine beaches, and clear tropical water, the small island nation is a beloved tourism destination. Over the last 20 years, the number of tourists to the islands more than doubled, reaching more than 380,000 visitors in 2019. Cruise tourism to the islands is growing as well, expanding from 15,600 arrivals to 44,000 arrivals in less than 10 years.  Tourism elevates the quality of life of residents by providing higher income generating opportunities and boosting the economy. Prior to the pandemic, the industry contributed 42% of the country’s gross domestic product (GDP) and employed over two-thirds of the workforce. However, tourism also places increased pressure on the islands’ limited natural resources and infrastructure. If tourism grows exponentially, it risks damaging the country’s fragile coastal ecosystems and reducing the quality of life of residents by competing for the same resources. As climate change also increasingly impacts the region, Seychelles’ leadership recognizes the need for continued monitoring of visitor impacts and proactive destination management. To ensure environmental protection, a quality visitor experience, and the well-being of locals, tourism development decisions are based on the needs and resources of the islands. This is determined by regular carrying capacity studies.  



Our Role 



In 2019, Sustainable Travel International conducted a new carrying capacity study for the Seychelles Ministry of Tourism, Civil Aviation, Ports and Marine. The study examined the implications of continued tourism growth in three of Seychelles’ most popular destinations: La Digue, Mahe, and Praslin. The carrying capacity of a destination determines the ideal number of international arrivals that can visit at the same time without causing destruction of local resources. It is not a static number, but rather can fluctuate over time based on the destination’s ability to handle visitors – for instance, whether or not there is sufficient waste management infrastructure in place. The goal of this type of study is to create balance and a sustainable tourism industry – i.e. determine how to generate economic growth while ensuring environmental protection, a quality visitor experience, and the well-being of local residents. Our team worked with local stakeholders, such as business owners, government officials, scientists, and residents to determine priority issues. Based on this input, we gathered data on current social, economic, infrastructure, and environmental conditions such as the amount of waste and emissions generated by hotels, the number of cruise ship passengers, the ratio of foreigners to locals employed in tourism, and the hotel occupancy rate. We then analyzed how different levels of tourism growth would affect these conditions and whether it would lead to problems, such as overwhelmed utility infrastructure or resident dissatisfaction. We also gathered data on the visitor experience to understand the current conditions and visitors’ thresholds for crowding. For instance, visitors were shown photos of different locations with varying degrees of crowding (people, boats, beach chairs, etc.) and asked to rate the acceptability of the conditions. GPS tracking was used to map visitor movement, quantify the level of density at each area, and identify potential areas of overuse or congestion.Managing hotel development and recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic was a top priority for all stakeholders. After analyzing various scenarios, we determined that moderate tourism growth over the next three years provides Seychelles the best chance of stimulating the economy and increasing visitor expenditure without overtaxing the natural resources and infrastructure. Based on this research, we developed a roadmap of policy and management recommendations for Seychelles to create a low-impact, high-value tourism industry that balances growth with risk. Some of the recommendations were as follows:Reduce pressure on existing waste management systems, such as landfills and wastewater treatment plants, which are already at capacity by building new facilities and reinforcing the ban on single-use plastics. Lessen resource intensity by requiring the use of water or energy-saving devices, investing in rainwater harvesting, and enforcing the vehicle quota as well as building codes that promote energy efficiency . Develop cultural and culinary experiences to complement the current visitor experience, which is based almost entirely on the beaches, and increase the amount of tourist dollars that flow into local communities.Temporarily halt the construction of new tourism accommodations on La Digue to avoid economic losses brought on by low occupancy rates. This recommendation was adopted in August 2021. More details on this decision can be found here.  Develop a contingency and recovery plan from the COVID-19 pandemic that includes health and safety guidelines for tourism enterprises and reopening strategies.Design a Tourism Capacity Indicator Framework to continually monitor the destination’s carrying capacity and regulate tourism growth accordingly.

St. Kitts Destination Guardians,"A collaborative training workshop that raises awareness around sustainable tourism and empowers Kittitians to act as Destination Guardians who take care of their island home. 



It Takes an Island 



In St. Kitts, tourism is everyone’s business. In 2018, the industry contributed more than 25% of the country’s GDP and supported 1 in four jobs. One way or another, every Kittitian is connected to tourism. When travelers come to St. Kitts, they seek natural beauty, rich cultural experiences, and authentic encounters with local communities. Consequently, the success of St. Kitts’ tourism industry depends on the health and appeal of the island’s local resources, from its beaches and parks to its arts and heritage sites. Ensuring the wellbeing of any tourism destination takes a whole village. Or in this case, it takes a whole island. St. Kitts’ communities, governmental agencies, NGOs, visitors, and the tourism industry all play a role in stewarding the destination and safeguarding their local assets.  



Our Role 



Destination Guardian Workshop 



To increase community engagement around destination stewardship in St. Kitts, we created the Destination Guardian training workshop. This workshop educates Kittitians about the importance of sustainable tourism and equips them with the knowledge they need to contribute to the long-term wellbeing of their destination. Each year, we deliver the workshop to another group of local residents, including government employees, teachers, community group members, and tourism industry professionals. Through a combination of informational presentations, group discussions, interactive exercises, and a field trip, participants learn about:The positive and negative economic, environmental, and socio-cultural impacts of tourism in small island destinationsWhat it means to be a sustainable destination How they can help protect St. Kitts’ natural and cultural resources and ensure tourism elevates local communitiesThe importance of collaboration to collectively tackle island-wide challenges At the end of the workshop, participants are asked to sign the Destination Guardian pledge and identify four concrete actions that they can commit to perform over the next year. 



Train-the-Trainer 



In addition to the general workshop, we also developed and facilitated a train the trainer session to prepare local community members to deliver their own Destination Guardian trainings. This session equipped participants with a deeper understanding of the Destination Guardian curriculum as well as the knowledge and skills to be more effective trainers.

Palau: Carbon Neutral Tourism Destination,"The Pacific Island nation of Palau is a tiny, yet remarkable country characterized by surreal landscapes, pristine seas, and a long cultural history. The archipelago is made up of more than 340 lush green islands jutting out from the glimmering ocean, only nine of which are inhabited. 







 



Remote and Secluded 



Palau is truly a hidden island paradise. The archipelago is surrounded on all sides by the vast Pacific Ocean and is located 400 miles north of Papua New Guinea, 550 miles east of the Philippines, and 800 miles southwest of Guam. 







 



Pristine Marine Wonders 



Palau’s waters teem with an abundance of marine life including over 500 species of coral and 1,300 types of fish. Thanks to its incredible natural beauty and biodiversity, Palau is considered to be one of the world’s top diving destinations. 







 



Dependent on Tourism 



In 2019, 90,000 tourists visited Palau. That’s five times the islands’ population. Tourism is the country’s main source of income and provides vital jobs for local people. In total, it accounts for nearly a third of Palau’s GDP. 







 



Commitment to Sustainability 



Though Palau may be tiny, it is bursting with big, bold ambitions. Environmental stewardship has always been the way of the Palauan people who know that their country’s future depends on healthy reefs, jungles, and beaches. 















Issues 







Vulnerability to Climate Change 



As a remote island nation, Palau is extremely vulnerable to the consequences of climate change. Rising sea levels and intensified tropical cyclones threaten to destroy houses, beaches, and infrastructure. Coral bleaching and acidic waters endanger the marine life that tourists come to see. Climate change is also expected to disrupt global supply chains, leading to food insecurity.Learn more about how climate change is impacting destinations. 







Carbon Footprint of Tourism 



Tourism depends heavily on fossil fuels and produces emissions that contribute to the climate crisis. Consider the carbon footprint of a vacation to Palau. Getting to the remote islands typically requires flying thousands of miles. Once in Palau, tourists generate CO2 by going on boat rides, turning up the AC, eating imported foods, and engaging in other activities.Learn more about the activities that contribute to tourism’s carbon footprint.  







Reliance on Imported Food 



Palau’s hotels and restaurants rely on overseas imports to feed their guests. In fact, 85-90% of the country’s food is imported from abroad. The importation of food and drinks produces carbon emissions and causes dollars to leave the local economy. Imported foods also tend to be more packaged and processed which contributes to waste management and health problems.  



















OUR ROLE 



Palau Carbon Neutral Destination Program 











With climate change a very real threat to Palau’s existence, Sustainable Travel International is implementing a project in partnership with Slow Food and the Palau Bureau of Tourism to help the archipelago become the world’s first carbon neutral destination. The project will combat climate change and boost community resilience by:Neutralizing tourism’s carbon footprintImproving the livelihoods of local food producersIncreasing local food securityEmpowering women to participate more fully in the tourism value chainConserving coastal ecosystems that act as carbon sinksReducing food waste and building a circular economy 


























Our Approach 







 



Strengthening Local Food Production 



The project will build the capacity of local farmers, fishers, and other producers to produce high quality products and market them to tourism businesses. 







 



Encouraging Sustainable Resource Use 



The project is optimizing resource use by encouraging local producers to adopt sustainable agricultural practices and helping chefs make the most of local food products.  



















 



Promoting Local Foods 



The project will reduce Palau’s dependence on imported foods and celebrate the islands’ gastronomic heritage by helping hotels and restaurants incorporate local ingredients into their menus. 







 



Developing a Destination Carbon Calculator 



We are creating an online platform that will enable tourists to calculate the carbon footprint of their trip to Palau, including flights, lodging, dining, excursions, and ground transport. 



















 



Including Women 



Palauan women are heavily involved in production activities such as farming taro and vegetables, crab harvesting, certain forms of fishing, and producing honeys and jams. Attention will be given to further link these female producers to the tourism value chain. 







 



Funding Conservation Projects 



Visitors will be able to offset their carbon footprint by contributing to conservation projects. These projects will reduce emissions and boost climate resilience by protecting/restoring coastal ecosystems that act as blue carbon sinks and natural storm barriers.

Developing Sustainable Tourism Initiatives in Antigua & Barbuda,"Facilitating a Destination Stewardship and Action Planning Workshop 



Located in the heart of the Eastern Caribbean, Antigua and Barbuda is a popular island destination known for its 365 beautiful beaches. Over one million tourists visited the islands in 2018, making Antigua and Barbuda one of the most tourism dependent countries in the world. Point in case: tourism is the top economic activity in the country, accounting for over half of GDP and supporting one in two jobs.Like many other small island destinations, Antigua and Barbuda faces various sustainability challenges. The islands have limited natural resources and are highly vulnerable to climate change. In addition, a strong dependence on cruise tourism limits the local economic benefits generated by tourism, as Caribbean cruise tourists tend to spend significantly less onshore than land-based visitors.To plan for sustainable tourism development, the Antigua and Barbuda Ministry of Tourism & Investment partnered with Sustainable Travel International in 2014 as part of the Sustainable Destinations Alliance for the Americas program. One of the outcomes of this program was the creation of a Destination Stewardship Council to oversee and coordinate sustainable tourism development in Antigua and Barbuda. To increase cross-sector collaboration, stakeholders from across government agencies, businesses, and NGOs sit on the council. 



Our Role 



To build upon this previous work, we again partnered with Antigua and Barbuda in 2019. This time our goal was to deepen stakeholders’ understanding of sustainable tourism and prepare the council to take concrete action.To accomplish this, our team facilitated a Destination Stewardship & Action Planning Workshop in October 2019. Attendees included members of the Destination Stewardship Council as well as representatives from the public, private, and civic sectors. Participants learned about the importance of sustainable tourism and discussed the positive and negative impacts that tourism can have on people and the environment. They were also introduced to the four pillars of destination sustainability and best practices related to each.On the second day of the workshop, participants visited a local nature reserve. During this field trip, they witnessed various examples of sustainability in action, such as natural heritage interpretation and water harvesting practiced at the site. 



 







After learning about sustainable destination principles and practices, participants worked together to assess the sustainability of their own destination. They scored Antigua and Barbuda’s performance against internationally established criteria related to community benefits, waste management, cultural preservation, environmental protection, and other sustainable tourism practices. Participants used these assessment results, along with their personal perspectives and experiences, to debate and identify the top challenges for destination sustainability in Antigua and Barbuda.Participants were then divided into groups based on their areas of expertise and assigned one of the prioritized sustainability issues. The workshop also included an informational session on project development and management best practices. Using what they learned in this session, each group developed a collaborative destination stewardship project and action plan to address their assigned issue. The resulting four projects focus on the following areas:Developing and adopting a national sustainable tourism strategyRestoring and improving visitor management at a historic sugar plantationRaising local environmental awareness Increasing local representation in management positions within the tourism industryThis workshop was just the beginning of the next phase of Antigua and Barbuda’s sustainability journey. With a strong foundation in sustainable tourism and project management, the Destination Stewardship Council will be able to refine and implement actionable solutions that guide the islands towards a more sustainable future.

Monitoring Lenga Tree Reforestation in Torres del Paine,"After forest fires scorched Torres del Paine's landscape, reforestation efforts are bringing forth new life and helping to rehabilitate the park 



Torres del Paine National Park in Chile is known to many as the 8th wonder of the world. With granite peaks that pierce the wind-blistered sky and glaciers that extend for miles into the Southern Patagonia Ice Field, it’s no wonder that tourism here has grown exponentially in the last decade. While this tourism brings significant economic growth and opportunity to surrounding communities, it sometimes comes at a cost to the park’s ecology. 











Since 1985, there have been three man-made forest fires in the park. All of these fires were started by tourists. The fires ravaged almost 1/3 of the park’s surface area, leaving many dense Patagonian forests unrecognizable and barren. These forests are primarily made up of two types of trees: lenga and ñirre. These native species have adapted to Patagonia’s strong weather and harsh climate, and contribute to the region’s iconic landscape. They also play an important role in sustaining the park’s biodiversity and ensuring watershed health. Indeed, many of the park’s 40 different mammals and 115 bird species, including the endangered huemul deer, rely on the park’s forest ecosystems for their habitat. Naturally occurring forest fires are nonexistent in this part of the world. That means when a species like lenga is devastated by human-induced fires, it won’t automatically recover. As a result, humans must intervene to rehabilitate and revegetate the ecosystems. In response to the fires, Chile’s National Forest Corporation, CONAF, began ecological restoration efforts to accelerate recuperation of the park’s damaged forest ecosystems. Lenga seedlings are cultivated in a nursery until they are ready to be transferred into the park. They are then replanted in small clusters, or “nuclei,” of 100 in the least resilient fire-affected areas. To date, more than 810,000 lenga seedlings have been planted in the park. 



Our Role 



Our Torres del Paine Legacy Fund program supported CONAF’s restoration efforts by monitoring the reforested lenga nuclei. Local Chilean volunteers joined us on field expeditions to collect data on the health and growth of the young seedlings. This data helps CONAF understand the tendencies of lenga and identify ways to improve reforestation efforts. In addition, the volunteers learned about the environmental challenges the park faces when it comes to reforestation and increasing tourism.  







 











In October 2019, a group of 10 Chilean volunteers accompanied by our Legacy Fund Field Director embarked on a monitoring expedition into the park. Over the course of eight days, they monitored the health of more than 13,800 lenga plants. Primarily working in the Pudeto and Carretas sectors of the park, these volunteers endured snow, howling wind, and off-trail terrain to gather data on the replanted lenga. 


























 







Between the previous monitor in 2017 and this expedition, few plants had died off. In fact, the majority had grown at a healthy rate. In many nuclei, the number of live plants was as high as 98 out of the original 100. These high initial survival rates show promise for the long-term health of these forests. Our volunteers from all over Chile were the heart and soul of this week of monitoring. Thanks to their positive attitudes and eagerness to learn, we were able to support the park and provide data that will be expounded upon in continued reforestation efforts. For more information about this program and our work in Chilean Patagonia, click here.

Sustainable Tourism Course for Small Island Policy-Makers,"An online course to foster sustainable tourism development and policy-making in small island developing states 



As one of the fastest growing sectors in the world, tourism is a key economic factor for many Small Island Developing States (SIDS). However, the size and geographic location of SIDS results in many vulnerabilities that limit their competitiveness in the industry. Additionally, unplanned tourism growth can present many risks for their ecosystems and inhabitants.Because of this, it is critical to ensure that tourism development in SIDS occurs in a sustainable manner that accounts for the needs of the local economy, environment, and host communities. Accomplishing this requires strategic planning, collaboration across stakeholder groups, and well-formulated policies and standards. Policy-makers and destination managers are some of the key groups who play a pivotal role in leading and fostering the sustainable development of the tourism in SIDS. 



Our Role 



To address this need and guide small island destinations towards more a sustainable future, we developed a sustainable tourism course specifically geared towards policy-makers and destination managers in SIDS. This course is being offered as an open online course in partnership with the Hamburg University of Applied Sciences and the Hamburg Open Online University (HOOU). The course is currently underway with nearly 500 students enrolled and a group of expert tutors guiding learners along the way.The course aims to address the shared challenges and promote the sustainable development of tourism in SIDS by:Enhancing participant understanding of sustainable tourism development and managementInspiring learners to think carefully and critically about current SIDS’ tourism issues and related tourism policiesEnabling participants to assess the opportunities that sustainable tourism strategies offer for SIDS in particularIncreasing participant understanding of how policy-making can improve tourism in small island statesBy bringing together a diverse group of learners and incorporating concrete examples from around the world, the course seeks to form a global SIDS learning community and foster cross-destination collaboration around sustainable tourism in small island states.

Investing in the Development of St. Kitts’ Tourism Workforce,"Facilitating a Train the Trainer Workshop focused on sustainable tourism 



Tourism destinations such as the Caribbean island of St. Kitts are only as strong as the people and businesses who make them up. From tour guides to hotel housekeeping staff, the local workforce are the building blocks of St. Kitts’ bustling tourism industry.  A competent workforce is essential to an excellent visitor experience. From the moment a visitor steps foot on the island, the tourism and hospitality workforce shapes their experience. Was the immigration officer welcoming? Did the front desk agent provide helpful information about the local culture? Was their hotel room clean? Each of these micro-moments that take place throughout a trip affects a visitor’s overall perception of the destination. One interaction can make or break whether the traveler returns home raving about their trip or vowing to never come back.Thus, in order to strengthen a destination and ensure its long-term sustainability, it is important to invest in the people who propel the industry forward. One of the best ways to accomplish this is to make sure that those in leadership roles are adequately prepared to support their staff’s professional development. 



Our Role 



As part of our ongoing partnership with the St. Kitts Ministry of Tourism we hosted a Train the Trainer Workshop with a focus on sustainable tourism in the Kittitian context. This workshop was geared toward managers in tourism businesses, particularly those with regular training and human resource responsibilities.On a sunny St. Kitts day in late October, 10 enthusiastic and ambitious participants joined us for the two-day workshop. Most participants held supervisory roles and came from various tourism-related organizations including accommodations, attractions, and restaurants.To kick off the training, participants were asked a simple question: “What one word represents what being a trainer means to you?” Uplifting words such as “inspire” “change” “leader” “educator” and “guide” were just some of the words that came to mind.Over the course of the workshop, our team supported participants in becoming the trainers that they aspired to be. The workshop focused on developing essential skills that will help participants be more effective communicators, leaders, and mentors – both on the job and in their personal lives. Participants learned about topics such as engaging different learners, creating supportive environments, and handling challenging situations. In addition, a particular emphasis was placed on how trainers and managers play a key role in bolstering business sustainability, both through staff development and other operational improvements.  Exercises and activities were woven throughout the training, encouraging interactivity and allowing participants to apply their learnings. Participants were incredibly engaged, eager to learn, and supportive of one another.  At the end of the workshop, each participant developed a training plan related to their individual training responsibilities – one participant created a plan for a culinary training, while another focused on guest services.Given their positions and roles in the tourism industry, the participants are well-positioned to apply what they learned in their day-to-day lives. We hope that this training will generate a ripple effect of impact and contribute to a thriving future for St. Kitts.

Sustainable Tourism Enterprise Program for the South Pacific,"The islands of the Pacific are a popular destination for many travelers looking to trade in city life for secluded beaches, cultural authenticity and stunning natural environments. While the small size and remoteness of these destinations makes for ideal getaways, these characteristics also bring along many challenges. Visitors often put increased pressure on the already limited supply of agricultural products, water and energy. This results in a further dependence on imported goods and contributes to excess waste production. On top of these challenges, the transportation of imported goods drives up carbon emissions, exacerbating the climate change impacts to which small islands are particularly vulnerable.The Pacific islands also must cope with economic vulnerability due to their geographic isolation and small size. According to the Asian Development Bank, 31 percent of Fiji’s population and 26.9 percent of Samoa’s population lived below the poverty line in 2014. Tourism is a key driver of economic development in these destinations. The industry has the potential to combat poverty by providing more jobs, growing incomes, and creating markets for local goods and services. However, there is still an opportunity for the tourism sector in the Pacific to be more inclusive of local suppliers and service providers and prioritize capacity building. This will help ensure that local communities are truly reaping the economic benefits of the industry. 











What We're Doing 



At the United Nations Conference on Sustainable Development (Rio+20) in 2012, Heads of State adopted the 10-Year Framework of Programmes on Sustainable Consumption and Production Patterns (10YFP), a global framework for action to accelerate the shift towards SCP including resource efficient and low carbon tourism, in both developed and developing countries. In 2015, the Pacific Sustainable Tourism Alliance (PSTA) was formed as a public-private partnership with the South Pacific Tourism Organization (SPTO) to help fast track sustainability in the region. Sustainable Travel International working with the SPTO under the auspices of the PSTA, was awarded a grant through the 10YFP Trust Fund call for proposals for Sustainable Tourism Programme to implement a pilot project focused on improving sustainable resource management in hotels in the Pacific.The destinations participating in the preliminary stage of the project are Fiji and Samoa; however the eventual intention is to expand to other Pacific Islands. Through this work, the partners hope to inspire a new commitment to sustainability among members of the local tourism industry and empower them to improve their consumption and production behavior by:Collaborating with local stakeholders to identify the barriers to sustainable consumption and production within the destinationTraining 100 hotel managers on sustainable tourism best practices such as sourcing goods locally, using resources more efficiently, and utilizing a supply chain that is more inclusive of local people and culturesRaising awareness among hotel managers on the financial and economic benefits of incorporating sustainability practices into their business operationsEquipping 100 hotels with a Sustainability Management System (SMS) – a digital tool to monitor energy-use, waste-reduction, water consumption, and sustainable sourcing 











Long Term Impacts 



By influencing the sustainability behavior in businesses and across destinations, this project will lead to a more robust economy and a better future for people and environments in the Pacific. The anticipated long-term impacts include: 














 



						Reduced consumption of nonrenewable resources (water, gas, electricity) and increased resource efficiency through recycling, greywater recycling and use of alternative energy sources					













 



						Decreased amount of waste and pollution generated by the tourism industry					

















 



						Reduced dependence on foreign imports through local production and consumption					













 



						Less carbon emissions being generated from the transportation of imported goods					

















 



						Increased tourism-related job opportunities and income streams for local people					













 



						Increased awareness and appreciation of local culture

Mesoamerican Reef Tourism Initiative (MARTI),"The Mesoamerican Reef Tourism Initiative (MARTI) worked in destinations bordering the world’s second-largest reef system to maintain a vibrant tourism industry that supports local communities and contributes to a healthy ecosystem. 



Stretching for 600 miles (965 kilometers) along the coast of Mexico, Belize, Guatemala, and Honduras, the Mesoamerican Reef is the second-largest reef system in the world. It supports a wealth of marine life including more than 500 species of fish and 65 species of coral. Along the shoreline, mangroves and seagrass beds provide habitat and foraging grounds for sea turtles, sharks, manatees, and dolphins. The coastal vegetation also filters silt and agricultural toxins contained in the run-off from large-scale agriculture further inland.While tourism is a welcome source of economic wealth and provides an important development opportunity for the region, the effects of poorly planned tourism and environmentally harmful practices damage the reef. The tourism industry benefits greatly from the beautiful land and seascapes, as do the two million local people who depend on the reef for their lives and livelihoods. However, the reef is highly vulnerable and needs to be protected to ensure its health, ecosystem services, and appeal. According to the Healthy Reefs For Healthy People Initiative, a group that tracks the reef’s health, more than 70 percent of the reef was listed in critical or poor condition in 2010. Unless these trends are reversed, the region’s fastest-growing industry threatens to undermine the very heart of what makes the region so attractive to millions of visitors each year. The natural environment is not the only thing at risk in this region. Local communities suffer from wage disparity despite living in a tourism hotspot. This is caused by a lack of fair-wage jobs and a commitment to the social-economic benefits of tourism. 



Our Role 



The Mesoamerican Reef Tourism Initiative (MARTI) was a multi-stakeholder private, non-profit partnership led by Sustainable Travel International, in conjunction with Amigos de Sian Ka’an, Coral Reef Alliance, Rainforest Alliance, Riviera Maya Hotel Association, and Grupo Intersectorial Isla Cozumel. MARTI was created in response to the realization that the rapidly expanding tourism industry in the Mesoamerican Reef region was a growing threat to the health of the reef.MARTI worked with the tourism industry in destinations that border the Mesoamerican Reef to raise awareness around this issue and implement best practices to conserve the reef. MARTI engaged the breadth of the tourism industry, including destination authorities, hoteliers, indigenous community tourism initiatives, cruise lines, and marine recreation service providers. It also provided training and know-how on sustainable practices tailored to local conditions. Throughout its 13-year history, MARTI delivered a wide range of solutions to the Mesoamerican Reef region. 



Reducing Water Pollution 



Many communities in the Mesoamerican Reef have poor wastewater treatment systems resulting in pathogens and pollutants entering the groundwater and, eventually, the sea. These toxins contaminate the groundwater and lead to the growth of macroalgae blooms that threaten to smother the reef. To address these issues, MARTI:Equipped policymakers with the information and tools they needed to create more robust standards for wastewater treatment. MARTI’s work in the Riviera Maya and Cozumel led local land-use planners to prioritize this issue in local land-use plans.Helped homeowners and businesses connect to the municipal sewage system. As a result of MARTI’s work, dozens of homes and businesses in Mexico and Honduras are now connected to the system and eliminating the seepage of raw sewage into the ground.Helped cruise lines reduce the amount of wastewater discharged into the ocean – both at sea and in ports. 



Tackling Climate Change and Encouraging Sustainable Resource Use 



Tourism businesses along the Mesoamerican Reef use a large amount of natural resources and emit above-average amounts of carbon dioxide, which speeds up climate change. To combat these emissions, MARTI has implemented plans that help tourism companies not only reduce their carbon footprints but also contribute to the creation of policies that work to reduce future impacts from new tourism development. To achieve these goals, MARTI:Worked with hotels to reduce their carbon emissions by establishing an emissions baseline, creating an actionable plan for greenhouse gas reduction, measuring progress over time, and promoting their achievements.Helped residents take a more active role in destination management — including influencing land-use policies that increase density in tourism hubs and create stricter environmental regulations for developers.Partnered with organizations such as the Riviera Maya Hotel Association to help numerous hotels conserve water by determining a water-use baseline, creating an actionable plan around water-reduction tactics, measuring progress over time, and promoting their achievements. 



Increasing Local Livelihoods 



The vast majority of tourism revenue in the Mesoamerican Reef region is generated within tourist hubs, such as the Riviera Maya. This makies it difficult for more remote communities to benefit from the booming tourism economy. MARTI has:Linked hotel owners with NGOs that bring artisans’ products to market. Scarves, rugs, jams, and other local goods are now sold at Riviera Maya hotels and resorts, which means tourism dollars are finding a means of reaching the remote communities.Established a community-led ecotourism destination that offers authentic travel experiences and an additional source of income for Mayan communities.

Kawésqar Community Tourism & Empowerment Project,"Community-run tourism to celebrate the forgotten heritage of Patagonia’s indigenous people  



While best known for its iconic glaciers and peaks, Torres del Paine and its gateway community of Puerto Natales also possess a rich cultural heritage. Much of this heritage is rooted in the history and traditions of the region’s indigenous people – the Kawésqar. A seafaring, nomadic people, the Kawésqar were among the first inhabitants of southern Chile’s channels and fjords. Today, only 13 Kawésqar communities remain across the Magallanes region.  Like many first peoples, the Kawesqár have been marginalized from the local tourism economy. Despite the fact that over 260,000 tourists visit Torres del Paine each year, few learn about the Kawésqar and their unique heritage. Traditions and stories of the past tend to be overshadowed by the dramatic natural landscapes the area is known for. The predominant historical narrative centers around the figure of the gaucho, cowboys descended from European immigrants. 



Our Role 



The Torres del Paine Legacy Fund is working with members of the Kawésqar pueblo to revitalize their culture through a series of capacity-building, tourism, and entrepreneurship trainings. Ultimately, this project will allow the participating communities to build a common narrative and create a space where Kawésqar can share their rich history and traditions with visitors and residents. The project imagines Kawésqar exchanging their traditions with tourists, and selling their food, art, and guide services. The Legacy Fund and its partners will equip Kawésqar communities with the necessary skills and knowledge to sustainably manage and develop their own tourism products.This indigenous empowerment project aims to enhance destination sustainability by:Raising awareness and increasing appreciation of the region’s indigenous heritagePreserving and celebrating waning cultural traditionsExpanding income generating opportunities for the Kawésqar peopleProviding a more diverse, immersive, and authentic visitor experience

Restoring the Base Torres Trail,"The most popular of Torres del Paine’s trekking routes is the Base Torres trail. And for good reason. After traversing through plunging valleys and rocky slopes, adventurers are rewarded with a breathtaking view of the park’s centerpiece – the “Towers of Paine. These three iconic granite spires tower high above a turquoise lagoon at the crest of the trail.During high season, the Base Torres trail can receive 1,000 hikers in a single day. This heavy foot traffic, causes significant wear and tear on the trail. As a result, the Base Torres trail is now severely eroded. Other factors, including the harsh climate, steep grades, and poor trail alignment only exacerbate these impacts. 



Our Role 



These degraded trail conditions not only pose a safety concern for hikers, they also impact the park’s sensitive ecosystems. Improving the Base Torres trail is an urgent priority requiring a large-scale, public-private effort. To address this challenge, the Torres del Paine Legacy Fund is teaming up with the Chilean National Forest Corporation (CONAF) and AMA Torres del Paine to implement a collaborative conservation project titled “Tu Mejor Huella para el Paine.”This project will restore the Base Torres trail system. Tread will be repaired and constructed following sustainable design principles. Creating a sustainable trail system will reduce erosion, lessen environmental impacts, and minimize the need for continual maintenance.Improved trail conditions will lead to a safer, more enjoyable visitor experience. At the same time, the rejuvenated trail will connect people with nature in an engaging and responsible way. Trail stewardship is key to protecting the long-term health of our national parks, particularly one as popular as Torres del Paine.

Giving locals a voice in tourism development in St. Kitts,"Implementing an island-wide resident survey to gauge community perceptions of tourism 



Employing 1 in 10 people globally, tourism has the potential to benefit a large number of people. By creating jobs, driving infrastructure improvements, and promoting inclusive growth, tourism is a powerful tool to fight poverty and foster community development.With all these benefits, one might assume that local residents would be fully supportive of tourism in their backyards. The problem is that sometimes tourism development has the opposite effect and diminishes local quality of life. Without proper planning, tourism growth can bring about new challenges for locals, such as unaffordable housing prices, dwindling resources, and a loss of cultural authenticity. Over the last year, there’s been increasing global discussion around the issue of “overtourism” and its consequences in more popular destinations, where some communities are literally telling tourists to go home.How then does a destination prevent this situation from happening before it’s too late? It all comes down to finding the balance between tourism growth and local needs.To ensure that tourism enriches local communities, destination managers must pay attention to resident concerns and engage them in development plans. Happy residents play a major part in creating an enjoyable visitor experience and successful tourism industry. When residents win, everyone wins. 











Our Role 



The Caribbean island of St. Kitts is a destination that is well aware of the importance of sustainable, community-driven tourism. The warm and welcoming Kittitian people are undeniably the heart and soul of the island. The St. Kitts Ministry of Tourism is working to make sure that they are at the heart of tourism as well, by giving them a voice in development.To gauge local attitudes toward tourism, Sustainable Travel International supported the Ministry in administering a resident survey in 2017. This was the first survey of this kind in St. Kitts. Over 320 Kittitians, representing all parishes and demographics completed the survey.  The results examine how well tourism in St. Kitts is meeting local needs, creating opportunities for residents, and impacting their quality of life. A follow-on survey was conducted in 2021 to analyze changes over time and identify opportunities where more can be done to adequately meet resident needs.Understanding resident concerns is the starting point. The next step is taking action to address any existing or potential issues. The Ministry is using the survey findings to guide policy and program interventions, making it a valuable tool for community development.Of course, as tourism grows and the destination changes, residents’ feelings and priorities will change as well. Engaging residents should be an ongoing process. We will continue to support the Ministry to create additional avenues for residents to share their opinions and be involved in decision-making, as well as implement future surveys to monitor changes over time.

Demonstrating the Economic Value of Panama’s Protected Areas,"Tourism in protected areas is a growing economic activity in many countries. By drawing visitors out of tourism hotspots to more remote regions, protected area tourism can bring new benefits to rural communities and indigenous populations.While protected areas provide significant economic value, there tends to be little data to actually back this up. Without reliable and quantifiable evidence, governments and communities may undervalue these natural areas and the benefits they deliver. As a result, important visitor management and conservation activities may be overlooked. Without these types of sustainability measures in place, tourism growth in protected areas can end up harming their fragile environments. 



Our Role 



One destination focused on developing sustainable tourism in its protected areas is Panama. The country’s 121 protected areas cover over 6.2 million hectares of rainforests, coastal reefs, and other sensitive habitats. An increasing number of visitors come to these areas for nature-based tourism experiences, such as trekking, snorkeling, rock climbing, and birdwatching.In 2017, Sustainable Travel International conducted an economic impact study to determine the value of these natural areas. For this study, our team examined the economic benefits generated by tourism activities within Panama’s protected areas as a way to measure their value.We began by reviewing Panama’s existing tourism data. This included more general statistics such as national visitor arrivals, protected areas statistics, and public use plans.To supplement this data, we collected more specific data on tourism revenues linked to protected areas.  We surveyed businesses in Panama’s protected areas and their surrounding buffer zones. Five protected areas were included in this pilot study: Camino de Cruces National Park, Altos De Campana National Park, La Amistad International Park, Chagres National Park, and Soberanía National Park. Survey participants were asked to provide information about their business, including the services they offer and their revenues.In addition to collecting data from businesses, our team also interviewed visitors to these areas. Through these interviews, we were able to gain a better understanding of who is visiting Panama’s protected areas, what they are doing, and where they are spending their money.    The study findings paint a fuller picture of the different groups that are operating in and benefiting from Panama’s protected areas. It also quantifies the economic value of protected area tourism. An added benefit of this research approach is that it provides data not only on impacts at the national level, but also on the value generated for local communities.The real impact of this data lies in its potential to influence destination planning and decision-making. By demonstrating the value of protected areas to the tourism industry, local communities, and the country as a whole, this data helps reinforce the importance of caring for these areas. We hope this data incentivizes improved conservation and leads to better visitor management in protected areas.Header Photo Credit: Billtacular via Flickr

Using virtual imagery to connect people to nature in Torres del Paine,"One of the most remote corners of the world can now be experienced like never before. Thanks to a partnership between the Torres del Paine Legacy Fund and Google Trekker, 360-degree imagery of Chile’s Torres del Paine National Park can be accessed online via Google Maps. Now, anyone, anywhere can virtually wander the trails through the park and explore the region’s rugged natural beauty.In March 2017, a group of Legacy Fund staff, partners, and volunteers hit the trails of Torres del Paine, taking turns with a Google Trekker camera strapped to their back. Navigating the park’s steep, wet, and rocky terrain is challenging under any circumstance. Imagine doing it with a 42-pound sphere on your back. The camera’s 15 lenses face in different directions, taking photos every 2.5 seconds. Because the device can be carried on foot, it is able to capture panoramic images of places that would otherwise be difficult to reach. In just four days, the Legacy Fund team captured a total of 9,099 3D panoramic photos. These are now pieced together on Google Maps, showcasing the grandeur of Torres del Paine.While nothing beats exploring the Patagonian wilderness in person, the new images are a nevertheless awe-inspiring alternative. By using Google Maps’ Street View, even those who can’t journey to southern Chile can still witness the incredible landscapes that make this such an iconic destination. Virtual adventurers can hop aboard a ferry to cross Lago Grey or view the Cuernos del Paine from Paine Grande campground. One of the most impressive segments is undoubtedly the trek atop Grey Glacier, a thick mass of ice stretching 3.7 miles wide and 98 feet high.

While the images primarily showcase the park’s beauty, they also expose some of the environmental wear and tear that has occurred throughout the park. Scarred tree limbs serve as a reminder of the damage left behind from recent forest fires, while eroded trails are the result of heavy use and limited maintenance resources.A sense of resilience and hope also pervades the images, which capture some of the park’s ongoing conservation efforts. Keep an eye out for the lenga tree nursery tucked along the interpretive trail at the Reserva Cerro Paine. Built with support from the Legacy Fund, this nursery provides a sanctuary for lenga seedlings until they are ready to be planted for reforestation. 



A unique awareness raising and conservation tool 



We believe that connecting people with our planet’s natural diversity is one of the best ways to inspire them to protect it. We hope that by giving people all around the world a close-up look at this spectacular destination, that this project will ignite an ever broader appreciation of Torres del Paine and compel more people to take action to protect this magnificent, but fragile environment.The new imagery could also serve as a useful tool for conservation efforts. By comparing the images to current conditions, park managers and conservationists can see how the park’s ecosystems and infrastructure changes over the years. When paired with supplementary data, this type of visual reference point could be helpful for prioritizing needs and evaluating progress.

Samoa Sustainable Tourism Charter and Foundation,"Encouraging sustainable business practices in Samoa’s tourism industry and enhancing support of local initiatives.  



Located in the Pacific, Samoa is comprised of ten islands, the largest and most known being ‘Upolu and Savai’i. Each island features distinct landscapes from tropical rainforests and volcanic landscapes to crystal clear lagoons and sandy beaches. The tourism industry is critical to the prosperity of Samoa’s economy and the livelihoods of the local people. According to the South Pacific Tourism Organization (SPTO), over 139,000 tourists visited the islands in 2015. Despite the influx of foreign visitors, authentic cultural traditions and values still dominate every aspect of life on the islands.As a small island nation, Samoa’s ecosystems are particularly vulnerable to environmental challenges brought on by climate change, unplanned development, and natural disasters. Impacts from mass tourism can also threaten traditional knowledge and cultural expression, which play an integral role in the Samoan way of life.Sustainably managed tourism has the potential to address these threats by enhancing climate change adaptation, strengthening community resilience, and funding environmental conservation. In addition to environmental protection, tourism also represents an opportunity to conserve the island’s cultural heritage, improve community well-being, and create career options for the Samoan youth.Samoa has been a regional leader in sustainable tourism interventions, but there is still potential for the destination to further engage tourism businesses and travelers in destination stewardship and be a model for other destinations in the region to follow. Sustainable Travel International is collaborating with the Samoa Tourism Authority to help small and large businesses play a more active role in ensuring sustainable tourism development. 



Our Role 



Sustainability Charter 



Hotels, tour operators, and other tourism providers have the power to either harm or benefit the destinations where they operate. Their impact depends largely on how they run their business – from who they hire to how they dispose of their waste.Part of our work in Samoa is focused on guiding these businesses—through the development of a Sustainability Charter—to identify and adopt more sustainable business practices. That is, practices that are respectful of the local people and environment, such as composting food waste and sourcing products locally. Giving local stakeholders and community leaders ownership of this process will ensure that the practices are feasible, appropriate, and impactful within the destination context. The Charter will also help to reinforce business innovation by highlighting and providing recognition to those businesses that are finding creative ways to incorporate sustainability. Widespread business commitment to these practices will contribute to community well-being, economic development, and environmental conservation. 



Foundation for a Sustainable Samoa 



In addition to encouraging business sustainability, our work in Samoa is also focused on using the power of the tourism industry to strengthen support for local conservation and community development efforts. To accomplish this, we partnered with the community to develop a travel philanthropy fund for Samoa.The travel philanthropy fund, the Foundation for a Sustainable Samoa, was launched in 2017 with a mission of maximizing community benefits from tourism in Samoa by creating opportunities for local people to improve their well-being and safeguard their natural and cultural resources. The Foundation is dedicated to supporting small-scale destination stewardship initiatives that contribute to the following four priority sustainability causes: youth career development, environmental education, community economic development, and waste management.  By capturing a largely untapped donor base of travelers and tourism businesses, the program will create a new funding mechanism for projects in need of financial assistance. In addition, the fund will raise traveler and resident awareness of key environmental and social issues facing the islands. By educating and uniting destination stakeholders around common causes, the fund will inspire collaboration to more effectively solve these problems. The fund will also be a way for stakeholders to highlight and share Samoa’s commitment to sustainability. By sharing stories of Samoa’s success, not only will the fund inspire activism locally, but it will also provide a sustainability model for other Pacific destinations to follow.

A Sustainability Standard for Tourism Enterprises in Panama,"As ecotourism grows within Panama’s protected areas and their buffer zones, it is crucial to ensure minimum quality, sustainability and safety standards in the tourism operations. To accomplish this, Sustainable Travel International worked with the government and local stakeholders to create a sustainability standard for Panama’s tourism enterprises.This standard will act as a regulatory framework for hotels, tour guides, land and marine transportation providers, restaurants, tour operators and community-based tourism enterprises. It will allow these tourism providers to assess their operations and practices in relation to a set of indicators on issues that affect the local environment, communities, and cultural heritage, amongst others. The standard will also serve as the basis for certification and will help travelers identify environmentally-friendly and socially responsible businesses.To ensure that the standard is relevant and feasible within the local context, our field team hosted a series of participatory onsite workshops. During the workshops, over 90 business and government representatives provided input on what practices to evaluate in relation to water and energy conservation, business operations, supply chain management, and environmental protection. Once the final standard was established, we held trainings for the local authorities and auditors responsible for implementing it and confirming business compliance.The sustainability standard has since been included in the national protected area services concessions law – making compliance mandatory for any businesses operating within protected areas. It has also been ​endorsed by the Ministry of Trade and Industry as  the “Panama Tourism Sustainability Standard.”

Planning for Community-Based Ecotourism in Panama,"With the abundance of natural attractions, it may come as a surprise that most of the 2.3 million annual visitors to the country rarely venture outside Panama City. However, until recently, Panama had not actively developed or promoted tourism in its parks, protected areas, and more rural areas. Sustainable Travel International partnered with the Republic of Panama Government to use this opportunity for tourism development as a means to increase conservation and create benefits for local communities. 



Benefits of Ecotourism 



Rural and Indigenous Communities 



In Panama and elsewhere, responsibly developed ecotourism holds the potential to stimulate local economies, benefit indigenous communities, and combat rural poverty. By creating alternative livelihoods for communities in and around protected areas, ecotourism presents an opportunity for indigenous people support themselves and their families as tour guides, food service providers, or handicraft vendors. 



Biodiversity and Conservation 



Because tourism often flourishes in biodiversity hotspots, ecotourism also has the unique ability to contribute to the protection of some of the earth’s most valuable natural areas and ecosystems. The revenues from park entrance fees and tourism concessions provide added funding that can be channeled into conservation activities and park maintenance. In addition, the income generated by ecotourism provides an economic incentive for local people to protect the natural environment so that it remains a valuable tourism asset. By educating travelers on the ecosystems they visit and their role in environmental stewardship, ecotourism can also increase traveler activism and support of conservation. 



Our Role 



In 2015 and 2016, our team worked with local stakeholders to analyze regional opportunities and challenges and map out a country-wide action plan for developing ecotourism in Panama’s protected areas. The resulting plan includes specific strategies for developing ecotourism in a manner that will enhance protection of Panama’s sensitive habitats and wildlife, promote inclusion of rural and indigenous communities and local culture, and foster capacity building and skills development. In March 2016, the Government of Panama and private sector officially adopted the plan and implementation is already underway.

A Sustainable Tourism Standard for Mountain Resort Destinations,"Offering picturesque natural landscapes, unique cultures, and countless recreation opportunities, mountain regions are popular tourism destinations. Particular care should be taken when developing tourism in mountain destinations, as their fragile environments and host communities can be especially prone to negative impacts. The Mountain IDEAL standard helps destinations balance tourism growth with local needs to protect nature and wildlife, improve the well-being of residents, and preserve cultural heritage. 











What is a mountain resort destination? 



Due to the diversity of mountain environments and communities, it can be difficult to define a mountain resort destination; however, most share the following characteristics:Typically are located in high altitude regionsTend to be rural areas where traditional industries, such as farming, ranching, and mining, intersect with tourism.Economy is highly reliant on tourism and outdoor recreationOutdoor winter and/or summer activities are centralOffer a range of accommodations and services that support visitorsHave a small local population that is heavily outnumbered by visitorsExamples of mountain resort destinations include ski and snowboard resort communities, national parks and their surrounding communities, andpublic land hiking/biking areas and their surrounding communities. 







 











Why Mountains Matter 









 





About 1/4 of the world’s population lives in or next to the mountains. 









 





Mountain areas attract 15-20% of global tourism. 









 





Over half of the world’s population relies on freshwater from mountain regions for drinking, hydropower, food production, and other uses. 









 





Mountains ecosystems provide a habitat for approximately 25% of terrestrial biodiversity. 















Key challenges in mountain resort destinations 






Climate Change
Decreasing Freshwater Resources
Economic Impacts of Tourism Seasonality
Natural Disasters
Habitat and Biodiversity Loss






 


Climate Change
Despite their dramatic and powerful appearance, mountain ecosystems are especially vulnerable to climate change impacts, such as rising temperatures and decreasing snowfall. Climate change is a contributing factor to many of the other sustainability challenges affecting mountain destinations. 









 


Decreasing Freshwater Resources
As a result of global warming, annual snowfall is decreasing in mountain regions and glaciers are rapidly shrinking or disappearing completely. In addition, as temperatures continue to change, snow will melt earlier in the year. This impacts freshwater supplies and the availability of freshwater in lowland areas. In mountain resort destinations, this is particularly problematic as tourism development places added pressure on water supplies. 









 


Economic Impacts of Tourism Seasonality
Because of the seasonal nature of mountain tourism, mountain resort destination economies tend to fluctuate throughout the year and local residents are challenged to find consistent employment. As winters get shorter, this means the winter ski season will likely get shorter too, which will further impact the economy and livelihoods in winter tourism destinations.









 


Natural Disasters
Mountain landscapes are particularly fragile and change resulting from climate change, population growth, and land development is likely to lead to an increased risk of environmental hazards such as drought, flooding, avalanches, and wildfires.









 


Habitat and Biodiversity Loss
Uncontrolled tourism development and increased human-wildlife interactions can result in loss of important mountain habitats and harm to biodiversity. It can also degrade the very landscapes and scenic views that attract tourists to begin with. In addition, increased development in fragile areas can create runoff and sedimentation which affects water quality and aquatic life.




















Mountain IDEAL sustainable destination standard 



Sustainability standards outline what it means to be a sustainable tourism destination by transforming the concept of sustainability into measurable criteria. They help destination managers evaluate how sustainable a destination is and identify opportunities forimprovement. In addition, standards help visitors identify sustainable tourism destinations.Developed in 2017 through a collaboration between Sustainable Travel International, the Town of Vail, and Walking Mountains Science Center, the Mountain IDEAL standard outlines not just what it means to be a sustainable destination, but what it means to be a sustainable mountain resort destination. It accounts for those challenges and priorities that are unique and most important to mountain resort destinations. This includes managing activities on public land, protecting scenic views, ensuring year-round employment opportunities, reducing energy-use related to snow making and melting, and embracing mountain cultural heritage.We believe the Mountain IDEAL standard is a significant development for sustainable tourism. Because it is based on the internationally recognized GSTC criteria, the Mountain IDEAL standard can be used in mountain resort destinations around the world. In addition, it also has the potential to help encourage collaboration between mountain resort destinations that share similar challenges, such as exchanging solutions and best practices.

Engaging the Aruba Community in Sustainable Tourism Planning,"Our team visited Aruba to present the results of the rapid destination diagnostic and meet with local stakeholders to map out a more sustainable future for the tourism industry 



Header image by David Kirsch / flickrLocated just north of Venezuela in the southern Caribbean, Aruba is a small island spanning only 70 square miles (181 square kilometers). While just over 100,000 people call the island ‘home’, these inhabitants are by no means the only people you’ll find on the island. Though Aruba may be small, its allure is mighty.  The constant sunshine, long stretches of white-sand beaches, and cool trade winds attract millions of visitors to Aruba’s shores year after year. In 2015, over 1.8 million people visited the island and took part in activities such as diving, kite-surfing, and exploring the desert-like hills of Arikok National Park.Given the small size of the island and the limited availability of natural resources, local stakeholders felt a need to determine how the tourism industry could more positively impact the environment and local community. With the aim of encouraging greater collaboration and planning around sustainable destination management, Aruba joined the Sustainable Destinations Alliance for the Americas (SDAA) in 2016.

Identifying the issues and taking action 



We began our work in Aruba last year with an initial onsite diagnostic in October 2016. During this first visit, we had the opportunity to meet with over 50 stakeholders from the government, businesses, and local community. By listening to their insights and seeing the island’s key tourism sites in-person, we were able to gain a better understanding of the current sustainability status of Aruba’s tourism industry. At the start of the new year, we returned to Aruba for a second time to share the diagnostic results with local stakeholders and to help them outline the next steps they’d like to take.Over 35 stakeholders, including representatives from the Aruba Tourism Authority, local hotels and tour operators, and other government entities, gathered for the workshop we hosted in Oranjestad. We began the workshop by presenting the diagnostic results. Remember how we said over 1.8 MILLION tourists came to Aruba? While these millions of tourists were exploring the island and pumping their dollars into the local economy, they also used energy, created waste and used thousands of liters of drinking water. The results of the diagnostic highlighted the different sustainability issues that we discovered within the tourism industry in Aruba.  Some of these issues were inefficient waste management, poor visitor management and monitoring, and low community involvement within the industry.Following the presentation of the results, we facilitated a discussion and action-planning activity. When asked which of the sustainability issues were the most important to them, there was resounding agreement among the attendees that dealing with the island’s waste should be one of the top priorities. Waste is a major problem affecting the island, especially since the current landfill is reaching its limit. One issue attendees cited was the occasional waste burning that occurs in the landfill. This causes air pollution and poses an environmental and health risk. Not only does the lack of a sustainable waste model waste negatively affect the visitor experience, but it also harms the island’s marine life and affects the quality of life of Aruba’s residents.Participants were then tasked with coming up for ideas about what action should be taken to address the waste issue. They discussed the pros and cons of having an incinerator, converting the waste into gas so that this energy could be used, and increasing recycling capacity. All of these options need careful analysis and the involvement of other players, so these will be the next steps to ensure that Aruba manages its waste in an appropriate manner. 











 







 



 











Local destination stakeholders attended an action planning workshop in January 2017 




Priority Action Projects 



In addition to the sustainable waste processing project, the participants identified three additional priority action projects during the workshop:  






 



Development of sustainability tourism standards: This project involves designing and implementing a set of guidelines for tourism sector providers including tour operators, restaurants, accommodation, tour guides, and transport providers. The creation of these standards will help ensure that tourism activities are performed in a manner that is safe, environmentally responsible, respectful of heritage and beneficial for the local communities.      					









 



Creation of a formal watchdog platform for the Destination Development Plan/SDAA actions: This project will establish a multi-stakeholder destination stewardship council that will enforce existing laws and policies as well as oversee the long-term implementation of the destination action plan. This watchdog platform will help to protect Aruba’s natural and cultural resources by improving the management of tourism sites and mitigating negative tourism impacts.   					









 



‘Bario Boost: Mi Dushi Bario’: This project will set up participatory platforms in each bario (neighborhood) that will give communities the opportunity to take part in tourism-related planning and decision-making. These platforms will also help to increase resident pride and awareness of their role in the tourism value chain.					














While these changes won’t happen overnight; the progress that destination stakeholders have made so far in developing an action plan is undoubtedly a step in the right direction. We look forward to continuing our work with Aruba and helping them make this vision a reality.

Ecotourism livelihood development in Indonesia,"Increasing the perceived value of forest conservation through ecotourism development 



Made up of over 17,000 islands dotting the Pacific and Indian Oceans, Indonesia is a country with rich natural and cultural wonders. From dense rainforests and towering volcanoes, to picturesque mountain valleys and secluded stretches of beach, Indonesia possesses some of the world’s most spectacular biodiversity. Indonesia has the third largest expanse of tropical forest in the world. At least 30 million people depend directly on Indonesia’s forests for their livelihood but deforestation rates are some of the highest in the world.The areas most at risk include the carbon rich peat forests in Kalimantan (the Indonesian portion of Borneo) as well as areas of northern Sumatra and Papua. From sequestering carbon and combating climate change, to providing freshwater for local communities, these forests represent a precious and vital resource. In addition, these forests are home to a number of critically threatened species such as orangutans and Sumatran rhinos and elephants. Reducing deforestation will help conserve the environment, protect rare species, safeguard the community’s livelihood, and preserve the destination for years to come. 



Our Role 



In 2015, USAID launched the LESTARI project to combat Indonesia’s growing threat of deforestation. LESTARI means “everlasting” in Indonesian and the project aims to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and improve protected area management in Central Kalimantan, northern Sumatra, and Papua.LESTARI  is a five-year project implemented by a variety of partners under the leadership of Tetra Tech and funded by the United States Government. Sustainable Travel International’s role in this project focused on identifying and developing alternative livelihoods through ecotourism.  Our specific goal was to develop a series of small scale ecotourism partnerships in Central Kalimantan and Aceh that have high conservation value, bring community benefit and are economically viable, appealing to domestic and international markets. Areas of particular focus are Sebangau National Park, Bukit Baka Bukit Raya National Park, Gunung Leuser National Park, and the Trumon-Singkil Wildlife Reserve.LESTARI targets a 41 percent greenhouse gas emissions reduction in its landscapes by project completion in 2020.

Improving Waste Separation in Barbados,"A small island developing state located in the Caribbean, Barbados is an increasingly popular tourist destination. 



In 2015, the island received over 1.3 million visitor arrivals. While this growing visitation brings added economic benefits for island residents, it also results in environmental and waste management concerns. As is a common issue in small island developing states, landfill space is limited in Barbados. This makes it extremely important for residents and tourists to engage in waste reduction and recycling practices. Despite recycling facilities on the island, waste separation systems at Barbados’ ports of entry and major tourist attractions are either insufficient or lacking entirely. This means that a significant amount of materials that could be recycled, such as plastic bottles and aluminum cans, are instead ending up in landfills. 



Our Role 



As part of Barbados’ participation in the Sustainable Destinations Alliance for the Americas (SDAA), an action-planning workshop was conducted to identify and address key environmental, social, and economic issues within the destination. During this workshop, local stakeholders prioritized an action project focused on tackling waste management issues within the destination.To reduce the amount of recyclable materials going to landfills, this project will establish waste separation systems at high traffic areas such as Barbados’ ports of entry and major tourist attractions. In addition, waste audits will be conducted and recycling receptacles will be procured and installed in the designated locations. These activities will be supported by awareness raising programs to encourage local residents and tourists to utilize the new system to properly dispose of their waste.

Linking local fishers to the Galápagos tourism economy,"Balancing marine conservation with community well-being by adding value to the local fish economy in Galapagos Marine Park. 



A biodiversity hotspot both on land and underwater, the Galapagos Islands are an area of extraordinary global biological significance.  Because the islands are extremely isolated, an especially high percentage of the species in the Galapagos cannot be found anywhere else on the planet. In addition, the region serves as a habitat for nearly 3,000 marine species and is home to the largest biomass of sharks on the planet. 



Marine Life in Danger 




Growing pressures from legal and illegal fishing practices increasingly threaten the islands’ unique marine life. Over the years, certain species such as sea cucumbers and lobsters have been exploited by overfishing. Sharks are particularly vulnerable as they are often hunted for their valuable fins which are used to make shark-fin soup – a delicacy in Asian markets.  The decline of shark populations extends far beyond the Galapagos region with scientists estimating that almost 100 million sharks are killed each year. At this rate, it is impossible for the sharks to reproduce fast enough to maintain their population. This not only threatens the long-term existence of many shark species, but also results in serious consequences for marine ecosystems as a whole.   



Conservation at Odds with Local Livelihoods 



Over the years, fishermen in the Galapagos have faced numerous added regulations as local priorities have shifted towards conservation and tourism development. Since the Galapagos Marine Reserve was created in 1998, commercial fishing has been restricted within its borders and local fishermen have only been allowed to practice artisanal fishing. In 2016, Ecuador formed a 15,000 square-mile marine sanctuary within the existing Marine Reserve.  By banning fishing in designated areas, the new sanctuary is designed help threatened wildlife populations to thrive. While conservation measures such as these are beneficial for wildlife, they can also have unintended consequences for local communities, such as the over 400 local fishermen and their families who depend on harvesting fish for their livelihoods. 



Our Role 



While it may be easy to point fingers at the fishermen and overlook their concerns, our experience has shown that environmental conservation and community well-being should go hand in hand.  As one of the oldest economic activities on the islands, fishing is deeply embedded within the Galapagos’ culture. For many of the fishermen, it is a way of life that has been passed down from one generation to the next. Losing the fishermen would not only alter the community’s identity, but it would also threaten local food security and drive up reliance on imported food – meaning higher prices for locals as well as an increased likelihood of new biohazards being introduced to the islands.  In addition, it would also diminish the authenticity of the Galapagos culinary tourism experience.To lessen tensions surrounding the new sanctuary, in 2016 Sustainable Travel International worked with the fishermen, government, park management, local businesses, and NGOs to identify ways to support those affected by the added regulations.  Through a series of interviews, workshops, and focus groups, our team was able to gain a better understanding of the problems and potential opportunities related to two intervention strategies: Increasing the value of locally-caught fishPinpointing alternative livelihood opportunities for fishermen within the marine tourism sectorThrough this collaborative process, we developed an action plan that outlines recommended next steps for the Government of Ecuador to alleviate the conflict and successfully implement these strategies. We hope that once this plan is put into action, that it will result in a beneficial future for both the wildlife and the residents of the Galapagos.

Ngorongoro Conservation Area Sustainable Tourism Strategy,"Assessing sustainable tourism issues and needs to protect one of Africa’s World Heritage Sites 



The Ngorongoro Conservation Area is one of Tanzania’s most visited destinations, covering 8,292 square kilometers of savanna, highland plains, savanna woodlands and forests. The area is internationally renowned for the Ngorongoro Crater, the world’s largest intact volcanic caldera; the resident pastoralist population; and the native wildlife including Africa’s ‘Big Five’ – the African elephant, Cape buffalo, rhinoceros, African lion and African leopard. The protected area also harbors a range of endangered species and supports one of the largest animal migrations on earth, making it a global priority for biodiversity conservation.The Ngorongoro Conservation Area is home to tribal communities who preserve their traditional way of life while co-existing with the area wildlife. The protected area also contains a number of key paleontological and archaeological sites where Hominid fossils dating back three million years were discovered. The Ngorongoro Conservation Area was declared a natural property on the UNESCO World Heritage List in 1979 and a cultural property in 2010.In recent years, the region experienced considerable tourism growth as well as an increase in the resident and livestock populations.

Improving Waste Management in Dominica,"Referred to as “The Nature Island,” Dominica attracts thousands of tourists each year to experience its wealth of forests, rivers and other natural attractions. However, growing waste management issues threaten the long-term health of these natural assets and prosperity of the tourism industry.Over 4 million kilograms of waste were generated in Dominica in 2014, of which the tourism industry contributed approximately 4.5 percent. This substantial amount of waste poses a problem as Dominica’s waste management infrastructure is inadequate for current or future needs. Resources are limited and there is a need for additional collection trucks, haulers, and recycling collection points. In addition, the inconsistent enforcement of policies results in missed opportunities for improved waste management. Because there are no policies or resources in place to address food waste in hotels, organic matter that could be composted is instead being sent to landfills. There is also a general lack of public awareness about waste management issues and the related environmental concerns. 



Our Role 



Kalinago Territory Waste Management 



Dominica is the only Caribbean island with a remaining population of pre-Colombian Carib Indians, now known as the Kalinago. The majority of this indigenous population lives in a series of small rural settlements that make up the Kalinago Territory on the northeastern coast of the Island. Due to the rich cultural heritage and traditions of the Kalinago, there is a high potential for community-based, cultural tourism in the region. This tourism development would create additional income opportunities for the communities, but it would also bring challenges such as added waste.During an action-planning workshop conducted as part of the Sustainable Destinations Alliance for the Americas (SDAA), local stakeholders identified a priority project focused on improving waste management in the Kalinago Territory. The goal of the project is to develop a model waste management plan for the region. Town hall meetings will be held to discuss waste separation and create a collection schedule. In addition, local residents will receive training to become garbage collectors and a truck will be purchased to start collection. This project will help ensure the Kalinago Territory remains an attractive destination for visitors and residents alike as community-based tourism grows. 



Composting for Tourism Businesses 



In 2015, Sustainable Travel International partnered with the United Nations Environment Program (UNEP) to develop a waste management tool for the tourism sector in Small Island Developing States. As part of this work, local stakeholders met for an on-site workshop and identified quick-win project ideas for improved waste management in Dominica’s tourism sector. Stakeholders chose to prioritize a project focused on implementing a food waste composting program in Roseau and its surrounding environs. Increasing the amount of food waste being composted by tourism businesses will reduce the amount of waste going to the island’s only landfill, prevent harmful environmental impacts, and lessen business costs. In addition, the implementation of a composting system also represents potential economic benefits as the finished compost could be sold for use by farmers or hotel gardens.This pilot project will target participation of 20 hotels, restaurants and related entities in Roseau and its surrounding areas. The vision is to address composting at a national level by scaling up the pilot project to other regions of the country based on lessons learned and funding secured.

Mayaka’an: A New Ecotourism Destination That Empowers Mayan Communities,"Despite being located near tourist hotspots and boasting rich Mayan culture and tropical landscapes, the Zona Maya of Quintana Roo and its Mayan residents did not reap the full benefits of tourism. To foster more equitable opportunities, the Mesoamerican Reef Tourism Initiative (MARTI) supported the establishment of Mayaka’an. This new ecotourism destination takes a sustainable, community-driven approach that benefits Mayan communities and offers an alternative to mass tourism. 



The Zona Maya of Quintana Roo is a gem that combines the charms of the Caribbean Sea with a living Maya culture, important archaeological sites, and the impressive biological richness of the Sian Ka’an Biosphere Reserve. Despite these treasures, tourism is underdeveloped, and small indigenous and community tourism cooperatives even saw the reserve as an obstacle to their development a la Cancun and the Riviera Maya, where millions of tourists come every year. The Zona Maya barely receives a hundred thousand tourists per year.The idea of creating a vacation destination in Quintana Roo was born in the 1960s when the Mexican government wanted to provide new economic opportunities to the Mayan people, who were impoverished and relied mainly on forestry activities and subsistence farming. The tourism industry thrived but Mayan communities remain as the poorest in the state. While only 4.3% of the population of Solidaridad —the municipality that includes cosmopolitan Playa del Carmen— live in extreme poverty, in the Zona Maya, 25% of the population lives in extreme poverty, earning less than US$1.25 a day.“We were indebted to the Mayan people. The tourism industry in Quintana Roo generates US$10 thousand million per year but the activity is concentrated in Cancun and the Riviera Maya. Mayan communities have been incorporated mainly as employees, waiters, and janitors. They have been the great forgotten”, says José Funes, delegate of the Ministry of Environment and Natural Resources (Spanish acronym SEMARNAT). 



Our Role 



To help reverse this situation, one of the most important ecotourism projects in Mexico was established in the Maya Zone: a new ecotourism destination called Mayaka’an.Mayaka’an was created in 2014 with help from the Mesoamerican Reef Tourism Initiative (MARTI), the Asociación Amigos de Sian Ka’an (Spanish acronym ASK), Mexico’s National Commission of Natural Protected Areas (Spanish acronym CONANP) and the Ministry of Tourism, with funding from the Inter-American Development Bank (IDB). The destination benefits 14 cooperatives in nine communities of Felipe Carrillo Puerto, Muyil and Punta Allen. “Mayaka’an was born to help organize and strengthen tourism cooperatives and to promote their services and the riches of the reserve, which are its greatest asset,” explains Gonzalo Merediz, Executive Director of ASK. The goal is to consolidate Mayaka’an as an economically profitable, sustainable and low-density destination, which will help bring social and economic development to local communities, while removing some of the pressure on Cancun and the Riviera Maya.The organizations did a market assessment, developed the brand and the tourism circuits, published a website, created sustainability standards for the destination and trained the cooperatives that comprise Mayaka’an. They also help the cooperatives market themselves and participate in major national and international tourism fairs. Mayaka’an was promoted at fairs in Mexico City, Chiapas and Nicaragua and it went to the World Travel Market in London.“We got calls from tour operators, including international ones, because thanks to this they learned that we exist. Mayaka’an put us on the map,” said Zendy Euan, an enthusiastic member of the Xyaat cooperative in the Señor community, which benefits 14 people and receives 250 to 300 tourists per year.The cooperatives, some of which have been working in isolation for more than 15 years, banded together and formed the Community Tourism Network of the Maya Zone of Quintana Roo, to facilitate more joint efforts. For example, some have already managed to obtain sustainable ecotourism certification granted by the Ministry of Environment and Natural Resources.“Thanks to working together and training, we can meet the strict requirements of hotels and tour operators,” says Román Camal, operations manager of Community Tours Sian Ka’an, one of the largest cooperatives in the area, with 12 partners and 25 workers. In 2014, they received 7,000 tourists. They are creating more attractions, including a Maya museum and a souvenir shop to enhance their tourism attraction.Although Mayaka’an is just getting started, Merediz emphasized that it has already had a social return on its US$500 investment.“The project is building our economy, and we believe it will get much better,” said Damian Gómez, president of the network. “The young men and women who finish high school leave the communities because there aren’t many opportunities here, but now they can stay and become entrepreneurs.”

MARTI Helps Hotels Leave a Lighter Footprint,"Hotel operations in Quintana Roo have a large impact on the well-being of the corals and wildlife that call the Mesoamerican Reef home. The Mesoamerican Reef Tourism Initiative and the Riviera Maya Hotel Association have launched a program to help businesses reduce their impacts on the environment. Hotels are empowered to reduce their energy use, recycle, use water responsibly, and properly dispose of trash 



The idyllic white sand beaches and turquoise waters of Quintana Roo have made it a favorite destination of tourists coming to Mexico. In 2014, the state received around 14 million tourists and visitors—56% of the entire country’s travelers. With more than 88,000 rooms, the tourism industry in Quintana Roo has supported a healthy economy, employment, growth and stability to the area. However, it has also created many environmental challenges. For example, Quintana Roo produces about 640.45 million tons of waste per year, and much of it comes from the hotel industry. 



Our Role 



Since 2006, the Mesoamerican Reef Tourism Initiative (MARTI), together with the Riviera Maya Hotel Association (Spanish acronym AHRM), has been helping tourism entrepreneurs reduce their environmental footprint on the natural ecosystems of the area. MARTI and AHRM promoted the implementation of the Environmental Management System, which includes criteria to reduce water consumption, achieve energy efficiency and properly manage wastewater and solid waste. In 2007, 17 hotels implemented the system, and in 2018 there were 130 hotels participating, accounting for 36,000 Quintana Roo hotel rooms (41% of the total in the destination).“At first we had to ‘sell’ the idea of having an environmental management system. The concept of sustainable tourism was little known. Nearly 90% of the hotels did not even separate or recycle waste,” said Fernando del Valle, operations manager for AHRM’s Sustainable Hospitality Program. “Now recycling is the norm, a part of their core operations; their efforts go far beyond. Sustainability has become part of their culture and they have outstanding environmental projects.”Hotels that joined the MARTI Environmental Management System underwent an environmental performance assessment, received training on the implementation of best practices for sustainable tourism, and were then evaluated to measure their compliance with the program. Since 2006, more than 26,000 hotel employees have received training through MARTI and 44 hotels have established a sustainability department or have at least one person dedicated to this area.MARTI measured the environmental achievements in a sample of 20 hotels and found that they have reduced, on average, their water consumption by 17%, energy consumption by 13% and the use of gas by almost 8% thanks to the implementation of the program’s best practices.“MARTI helped put us on the right path; it gave us training on reducing the footprint of our hotel, and recommended specific changes that we should make and indicators to measure our progress,” said Katia Cordourier, director of the Ecological Foundation of Bahía Príncipe Hotels & Resorts, one of the first hotels to join the MARTI program.Bahía Príncipe has reduced the waste in its four hotels to 20 tons per day, of which 8 tons are recycled, and 40% of the organic waste is donated for composting. They have replaced lighting, cooling and heating systems with other efficient energy systems. In addition, they intend to replace their electronic equipment with a more energy efficient version, and to replace 100% of the gasoline-powered carts used for internal tourist transport with a fleet of electric vehicles.For six hotels of the Karisma Group that have been MARTI members since 2008, the program marked a before-and-after point. “MARTI triggered our commitment to responsible resource management and helped us position it as a central focus of our work,” explained David Ortegón, corporate director of sustainability for Karisma. MARTI’s principles are the basis of the chain’s environmental management system, called Passion for Sustainability.Karisma’s Azul Beach Hotel treats and uses 100% of its wastewater other than pool water to irrigate 80% of the green areas and clean other areas. This reduced the amount of wastewater that could infiltrate groundwater and damage the reef, and it also lowered the high cost of watering using potable water. By replacing air conditioning and refrigeration systems and using LED lighting, Azul Beach also reduced its electricity consumption from 40 to 30 kilowatt hours per guest. At El Dorado Royale hotel, alongside similar measures for resource conservation, Karisma built a modern, certified sustainable greenhouse where 15 crops are produced to supply their restaurants. The greenhouse uses an efficient drip watering system to fertilize the plants. The unused water that drains from the plants is recycled and reused for watering.Around 50 MARTI members have also achieved environmental certifications from certifiers such as Green Globe, Earthcheck, Rainforest Alliance, and Travel Life and Tourism Environmental Quality.“The change that MARTI encouraged among the hotels is exemplary,” noted José Funes, Quintana Roo Delegate to the Ministry of Environment and Natural Resources (SEMARNAT), “it managed to engage the private sector in tourism sustainability and their efforts are little-by-little improving the whole destination.”

Planning for Sustainable Destinations Along the Mesoamerican Reef,"Four of the Mesoamerican Caribbean’s most popular destinations are working hard to balance sustainability with business growth through their partnership with the Mesoamerican Reef Tourism Initiative (MARTI) and Sustainable Travel International. Riviera Maya, Cozumel, Roatán, and Utila have assessed their environmental footprints and developed plans to receive sustainable destination certifications. 



Riviera Maya, Cozumel, and the Honduran Islands of Roatán and Utila are some of the most visited places in the Mesoamerican Caribbean. Roatán faces a unique set of challenges, as it is the second most-visited cruise ship arrival port in Honduras. The popular island destination of Cozumel seeks to preserve its fragile reefs and protect its unique cultural heritage. In Riviera Maya, hotels work to balance a booming tourism industry with environmental preservation. MARTI officials have collaborated with locals, governmental organizations, and tourism industry professionals to solve each destination’s most pressing sustainability challenges. 



Our Role 



In Cozumel, the rapid sustainable destination diagnostic, which was done using more than 100 criteria, was completed in 2012. Since then, MARTI’s partners, the Cozumel Island Intersectoral Group (Spanish acronym IG) and Sustainable Travel International, supported the Municipality of Cozumel in integrating principles for sustainability into its public policies.“The diagnostic gave us strong grounds for recognizing the areas on which we should focus in the coming years if we want to remain a sustainable and competitive destination,” said Federico Ruiz, Cozumel’s Deputy Technical Secretary for Sustainable Development. After the diagnostic, the “Agenda for Action on the Sustainability of Cozumel Island as a Destination” was developed, setting priorities such as getting a destination-level seal of quality and sustainability for tourism operators, promoting the sustainability of Cozumel and highlighting its cultural, natural and historical heritage, and developing a destination-level water conservation program.Ruiz emphasized that these priorities were integrated into the Cozumel Island Strategic Sustainable Development Plan 2012-2032 (Spanish acronym PETSIC), formulated with assistance from UNESCO. MARTI, through the GI, is supporting several aspects of the PETSIC with projects such as a water protection campaign, the eradication of lionfish, and the promotion of sustainable practices among marine tour operators. It also conducts environmental activities under the San Gervasio Agreement, an initiative to improve social development and the insular conditions of Cozumel.Support from MARTI has also been crucial to conserving natural heritage in Cozumel. In 2011, it promoted the creation of the Cozumel Forest and Wetlands State Reserve (19,846 ha), and it succeeded in protecting the northern part and the eastern terrestrial and marine coastline of the island (37,829 ha) in 2012.In the Riviera Maya, MARTI partners are working with representatives from the hotel industry, the Ministry of Tourism, academic institutions, and conservation organizations to take their sustainability efforts to the next level by adopting a destination management approach and achieving an international certification for the Riviera Maya as a sustainable tourism destination. In 2014, Sustainable Travel International implemented a destination assessment that highlighted the strengths and weaknesses of the Riviera Maya’s tourism industry, and helped define priorities and next steps that need to be taken to continue the certification process. A group of 30 leaders and stakeholders are working to establish a destination management organization for the Riviera Maya, which was defined as a key priority. The group developed a collective vision and a financial model for the new organization and is currently working to implement it. An action plan is also being developed, through multi-stakeholder planning workshops.

Guardians of the Sea in Cozumel,"In Cozumel, an island off the coast of Mexico, tourism has threatened the fragile reef. To prevent further damage, MARTI partnered with Cozumel Reef National Park to require a Sustainable Marine Recreation (SMR) course for tour operators who take visitors to see the reef. This course helps tour guides explain reef-safe practices to their visitors and prevents them from harming the environment by dumping waste into the ocean. 



The beautiful island of Cozumel rests on a rich marine ecosystem with coral reefs that attract more than five million visitors per year. It is estimated that 1500 to 1800 divers and snorkelers swim daily in the waters of Cozumel Reef National Park.Conserving these valuable and fragile ecosystems against threats from rising tourism has been a challenge for the park authorities. In the past, they had to deal with tourists who touched the corals and marine animals, and dive boats and tours that were not careful with the disposal of solid wastes or even hazardous wastes such as engine oil and fuel.“We have only four park rangers and three patrol boats. It became impossible for us to take care of the park ourselves,” said Christopher González, Director of the park.Now, González proudly says that the park has thousands of eyes that watch over it every day. 



Our Role 



Through the MARTI initiative, its partners the Coral Reef Alliance and the Cozumel Island Intersectoral Group (or GI for the Spanish acronym) have designed a course on Sustainable Marine Recreation (SMR), which CONANP uses to train all tour and dive guides who enter the park about the importance of the reefs and their stewardship, including the regulations that must be met within the protected area. The SMR course is now mandatory and has been given to more than 7,000 people in six years. Entities such as the Naval Secretariat (Spanish acronym SEMAR) and the Federal Attorney of Environmental Protection (Spanish acronym PROFEPA) use the SMR course for personnel working in these marine areas.“The course opened our eyes to the consequences of our bad practices, although minor, in the ecosystem that gives us work,” says Danirel Álvarez, marine tourism guide for the Sand Dollar Sports tour operator. “We learned to take care of wildlife, not pollute, and raise awareness in tourists,” added Alvarez.MARTI and its partners also created the Environmental Walk-Throughs program (EWT) for diving and marine tour companies, to evaluate their behavioral practices within the park, the status and management of their vessels, and the management of their waste products. CONANP has implemented EWTs for 83 providers of these services, out of the 113 that are working on the island.These evaluations have enhanced the monitoring system of impacts on the park, and identified the priority areas in which most service providers are failing, which are forming the basis of educational campaigns. According to Gonzalez, this data has been crucial in defining integrated mandatory compliance policies for the Cozumel Reefs National Marine Park Management Program.For tourism entrepreneurs, initiatives such as SMR and EWT have changed the mentality in the sector and enlisted businesses in promoting sustainable tourism at Cozumel. “At first, there was conflict because the park put more rules on us, but we understand how all this has benefited the business and the island that we love,” said John Flynn, owner of Sand Dollar Sports.

Building Sustainable Infrastructure in the Mexican Caribbean,"With real estate development growing rapidly in Quintana Roo, MARTI, the Asociación Amigos de Sian Ka’an (Spanish acronym ASK), and the Ministry of Tourism of Quintana Roo launched the Guide for Sustainable Planning, Design, and Construction in the Mexican Caribbean. Within this guide, developers can find more information about local laws, tips to protect fragile ecosystems, information about Quintana Roo’s unique environmental features, and methods to create a development that withstands the effects of climate change. 



Quintana Roo has several features that make it a unique site and the one most visited in Mexico, with 900 km of beach on the Caribbean Sea along the Mesoamerican Reef System, an impressive system of aquifers, karst soils and 3 million hectares of forest. Unfortunately, rapid real estate development spurred on by a thriving tourism industry has damaged these ecosystems, partly due to the lack of clear guidelines and plans for construction and growth that respect the unique geography and nature of the destination.While government authorities had integrated some guidelines into the Local Ecological Zoning Programs (Spanish acronym POEL) of each municipality, the POELs tend to be unfamiliar or confusing for real estate developers. 



Our Role 



In 2012, MARTI, through the Asociación Amigos de Sian Ka’an (Spanish acronym ASK) and the Ministry of Tourism of Quintana Roo, launched the Guide for Sustainable Planning, Design and Construction in the Mexican Caribbean, as an alternative to this problem.The guide is intended for real estate investors and includes a compilation of the regional characteristics of the state, its legislative and regulatory aspects, and an explanation of environmental and urban legislation and regulation. It also provides tools to determine the feasibility of a project, procedures to ensure the legality of the paperwork and operations, and it gives recommendations on design and construction.“This guide provides a complete and easy way to understand the legislation and all the aspects that one needs to know when developing a real estate project. But, for me, even more valuable is that it helped integrate the environmental part that previously had been viewed as something totally separate from the urban development sector,” said Sergio Vasquez, Director of Urban Tourism Studies for the government of the state of Quintana Roo.Environmentally, Vásquez says, the guide not only points to the need for infrastructure to protect mangroves and not contaminate water, it also advises developers on how to protect their projects from the effects of climate change, the karst soils, and the winds. In Quintana Roo, roads and hotels have collapsed into sinkholes, because the subsoil features were not considered and projects were built above caverns. In addition, the infrastructure is highly vulnerable to natural disasters related to climate change.The guide is positioned as a tool for voluntary compliance, a valuable reference document for developers, and an educational tool in the schools of architecture and engineering. The guide is available online and 2,000 printed copies have been distributed. At least 450 engineers and architects in Responsible Project Director (RPD) positions in Quintana Roo were trained with the guide.The criteria from the guide have also become the basis for the creation and updating of several POELs, such as the ones for Benito Juarez, Solidaridad and Othon P. Blanco. Thus, components of the guide’s criteria are now part of the law. “Quintana Roo will continue to grow, this cannot be avoided,” said José Funes, delegate of the Ministry of Environment and Natural Resources (Spanish acronym SEMARNAT). “These tools are essential to ensuring truly sustainable development and they are helping entrepreneurs adapt to new challenges, such as climate change.”

Riviera Maya Hotels Commit to Becoming Climate-Friendly,"The MesoAmerican Reef Tourism Initiative (MARTI) works with 130 hotels in Quintana Roo to help them improve their sustainability programs. The Sustainable Hospitality Program has been incredibly successful, helping hotels implement programs that reduce guests’ carbon footprint during their stay. The Palladium Hotels and The Bahia Principe Hotels are two hotel chains that have made particularly significant efforts to reduce the environmental impacts of their operations. 



Tourism accounts for 8% of global CO2 emissions. In Quintana Roo, where there are more than 900 hotels and 88,000 rooms. The tourism industry generates high carbon emissions and is very vulnerable to the consequences of climate change, such as rising sea levels and natural disasters like Hurricane Wilma, which devastated the industry in 1995. 



Our Role 



To help hoteliers confront these challenges and position Quintana Roo as a low-emission destination, MARTI included new evaluation criteria for the reduction of carbon footprints in its Environmental Management System, in which 130 hotels participate. In 2012, the Riviera Maya Hotel Association (Spanish acronym AHRM) began working with 10 hotels- with a total of 6,610 rooms, to implement the new criteria, measure the hotels’ carbon footprints to establish a baseline, and create action plans to reduce them. 
“The action plans include measures to reduce energy consumption and direct emissions that are related to power plants, refrigerant gases and vehicle emissions. We further propose that hotels adopt programs to offset their footprints by purchasing carbon credits,” said Fernando del Valle, operations manager of the AHRM’s Sustainable Hospitality Program.
All hotels participating in the MARTI program have made efforts to save energy by replacing lighting, heating, air conditioning and refrigeration equipment with energy efficient models. However, these 10 hotels expanded their efforts by voluntarily pledging to reduce their carbon footprints 3-5% by 2017. This represented a reduction of more than 5,800 tons of CO2 — equivalent to the annual emission of 969 cars.
The Palladium Hotels, one of the largest hotel groups of the Riviera Maya, participated in this initiative. Between 2014 and 2015, they achieved a 15% reduction in greenhouse emissions, going down from 16.4 kg of CO2 per guest per night to 13 kg. The hotels adopted measures that include the installation of occupancy sensors in guest rooms that automatically adjust the temperature and eliminate unnecessary air-conditioning; new software that allows the hotel to control the climate in all facilities and guest rooms; and the replacement of its cars with electric vehicles.
The Bahía Príncipe Hotels also worked to reduce their carbon footprint. They’ve implemented energy and gas reduction practices similar to the Palladium, and built electric vehicles to replace the automobile fleet used for internal tourist transportation. “Our goal [was] to reduce emissions from transporting our guests to zero by 2016,” noted Manuel Jesús Gómez García, Deputy Director of maintenance for Bahía Príncipe.
MARTI’s partner the Asociación Amigos de Sian Ka’an (Spanish acronym ASK), together with the Ministry of Tourism, the Ministry of Environment, and the EarthCheck certification and advisory group, made a major contribution to carbon reduction efforts by developing the first carbon footprint inventory for the hotel industry in Riviera Maya—it was also the first one done in Quintana Roo–, calculated in 31.47 kg of CO2 per guest per night. ASK also produced and disseminated a climate change mitigation strategy and an adaptation manual for the tourism sector.“Data from the inventory and the measures proposed in our strategy and manual were included by the Government in the State Action Plan for Climate Change and they will be useful to the Low Carbon Emissions Strategy for Tourism in Quintana Roo,” noted Gonzalo Merediz, executive director of ASK.
Twelve hotels have signed additional agreements with ASK and EarthCheck to further reduce their carbon footprints and advance adaptation to climate change. EarthCheck will conduct monitoring and give them technical advice on lowering their energy consumption and reducing pollutant gases, as well as carrying out efforts to reforest mangroves, respect the shoreline and make their infrastructure less vulnerable to extreme weather events.

Improving Water Quality to Safeguard the Mesoamerican Reef,"MARTI helped communities expand access to wastewater treatment and education in Quintana Roo, Mexico, and Roatán, Honduras. The program provided residents with wastewater treatment hookups and educated thousands of children about the importance of proper water treatment. By providing locals with a way to treat their dirty water, MARTI successfully prevented hundreds of gallons of wastewater from polluting fragile coral reefs and vital sources of freshwater. 



One of the main threats to the Mesoamerican Reef is pollution from wastewater. In the Caribbean, 85% of wastewater is discharged untreated into the sea, according to the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP). This water is loaded with contaminants and nutrients that, among other factors, cause algal blooms that compete with corals for space, oxygen, and light. In excess, they can reduce coral reproduction and cause its death. 



Our Role 



MARTI is working diligently, through its partners, with local authorities, community groups, and the tourism industry in Quintana Roo, Mexico, and on the island of Roatán, Honduras, to reduce the amount of untreated wastewater that ends up on the reef.“In Quintana Roo, all water sources are underground, very little known and highly vulnerable to pollution from inefficient wastewater treatment plants,” explained Gonzalo Merediz, executive director of MARTI’s partner Asociación Amigos de Sian Ka’an (ASK). ASK mapped these underground aquifers, using satellite technology, and collected data that has been key to increasing awareness and convincing local authorities to develop stricter policies for sanitation and water conservation.In 2012, ASK and the Riviera Maya Hotel Association (Spanish acronym AHRM) also assessed the performance of treatment plants in a sample of 19 hotels and found that 70% were operating inadequately. In response, they trained plant operators at the hotels and, with help from the Potable Water and Sewer Commission (Spanish acronym CAPA), created a public manual for the correct operation of water treatment plants.In the municipality of Tulum, ASK promoted the connection of households to the local water treatment plant, which has been working at only 3% of its capacity. Thanks to this project, more than 200 households have connected, and more will connect until the plant is operating at 100% capacity. This effort will be replicated in Playa del Carmen, where 3,000 houses could benefit.ASK and the Cozumel Island Intersectoral Group (Spanish acronym GI) are also supporting the campaign “You are water, become aware!”“The campaign will last from four to six months and statewide it will disseminate messages in print and on radio and television to raise awareness about the importance of our aquifers, the reefs and the relationship that consumption behavior has on the health of these ecosystems,” said Javier Pizaña, president of the GI.In Cozumel, GI has trained 1,800 students from five schools on water conservation. Students attend the Water Culture Space (Spanish acronym ECA), a special room where they learn interactively and through play. The goal is to train 2,800 students, 78% of the island total.In addition, ASK established the first local fund to pay for environmental services related to water. The fund covers two plots in Benito Juárez (one is an ejidal (common area) and one is private), which total 400 hectares, and it is being financed with donations from guests at various hotels, as well as with funds from The Nature Conservancy and the National Forestry Commission (CONAFOR).In Roatán, support from MARTI through the Coral Reef Alliance has been instrumental in getting nearly 70% of households (more than 200) in West End, one of the most commercial areas on the island, to connect to the local wastewater treatment plant.“MARTI is funding water quality monitoring for the reef, which is our key tool for convincing local authorities to promote wastewater treatment,” said Giselle Brady, technical coordinator of the Bay Island Conservation Association.Before inaugurating the plant in 2012, all houses and businesses discharged their water into old septic tanks. “This was an urgent need because tourism continues to grow and this is increasing the impact of untreated wastewater on the main source of income for the entire island,” explained Ian Drysdale, coordinator in Honduras of Healthy Reefs for Healthy People.The lack of resources to create infrastructure has delayed connecting 100% of households. However, organizations such as MARFUND and the state entity Tourist Free Zone (Spanish acronym ZOLITUR) has donated funds to expand coverage. MARTI will continue to support water monitoring to measure the impact of connecting these households to the treatment plant.

Lionfish: From Invader to Gourmet Dish and Sustainable Income,"Since 2009, venomous lionfish have been invading Cozumel Reef National Park, killing native fish and scaring both locals and tourists. Mexico’s National Commission of Natural Protected Areas (CONANP) quickly launched a successful campaign to get locals and tourists involved in turning the invasive species into a popular menu item. Divers and fishermen hunt the lionfish and send it to restaurants where it is cooked and served to hungry customers.  



In 2009, the sighting of an unwanted guest caused great alarm on the island of Cozumel, in the Mexican Caribbean. “It was actually a dive guide who saw it and alerted the park,” remembers Christopher Gonzalez, director of Cozumel Reef National Park. It was a lionfish—an invasive, predatory species, full of venomous spines. “Immediately we covered the island with warning materials and the lionfish gained a very bad reputation.”
Soon, experts showed that the fish was not hazardous to humans and in fact, its meat was very nutritious. Even so, eradicating it was still urgent because it affected the health of the marine ecosystem. 



Our Role 



Mexico’s National Commission of Natural Protected Areas (CONANP), tourism entrepreneurs, academic bodies, civil society and conservation organizations deployed a successful campaign that has positioned Cozumel as a global example in lionfish eradication.“Tourism was a key ally of success,” says Gonzalez. CONANP was already using its Environmental Walk-Through program, carried out jointly with MARTI, Coral Reef Alliance and the Cozumel Island Intersectoral Group (Spanish acronym GI), to train marine tourism operators on environmental topics and regulatory compliance for marine ecosystem stewardship. “Since they already had strong environmental awareness, they did not hesitate in helping us eradicate the lionfish.”With support from MARTI and the GI, tour operators were trained in the identification and safe capture of lionfish and appropriate equipment was purchased to avoid damaging the reef. Suddenly, divers and guides were bringing in dozens of lionfish. Park staff kept records on the catch and then let the divers take the fish home to eat. They also began to organize tournaments for the capture of lionfish, holding seven of these events since 2010.The park began hosting culinary demonstrations to promote the consumption of the abundant lionfish, and in 2011, 30,000 recipes were developed and distributed. For GI president Javier Pizaña, this was paramount. “People learned to eat them and not be afraid, fishers saw a good economic opportunity and restaurants featured it as a special dish on their menus. In addition, everyone feels they are helping take care of the reef.” Simultaneously, the GI carried out lionfish educational campaigns in the local schools, including a theatre play that was seen by 6,000 students in four months.CONANP also trained fishermen and gave them subsidies to promote lionfish fishing outside the park. Other organizations created business plans for them to market the product.“Thanks to these efforts, a good market was opened. Today we sell lionfish at a price that is better than the prices for four of the species that were our mainstay. We are happy because we are caring for the sea and our income has risen,” said José Pérez, president of the Cozumel Fishing Production Cooperative, the largest fishing cooperative on the island with 80 members. They have a restaurant where lionfish is the star ingredient.In Cozumel today, more lionfish are captured and consumed than any other species and they are even imported from fisheries off the island. Tour operators still capture lionfish but mainly as part of their tours, providing entertainment and education for visitors. Cozumel reports one of the lowest lionfish densities in the Caribbean, with 14 individuals per hectare, while other countries report even 400 lionfish per hectare.

Greening Tourism Growth in Quintana Roo,"The Mesoamerican Reef Tourism Initiative (MARTI), the Asociación Amigos de Sian Ka’an (ASK), and Quintana Roo’s governmental authorities have worked together to integrate strict environmental criteria into the area’s Local Ecological Use Programs (POELs). When creating this criteria, groups focused heavily on protecting Quintana Roo’s freshwater resources by providing better water treatment, stewardship of natural filters like mangroves, and promoting more efficient use of water resources through the use of innovative technology. 



Quintana Roo, the engine of tourism in Mexico, never stops growing. The Ministry of Tourism’s Directorate of Planning for Urban Tourism Studies estimates that by 2020, the state will have 125,000 rooms—37,000 more than today. In addition, as more tourists arrive and tourism infrastructure is expanded, new residents and urban residential development will come as well. This has triggerred increased pressure on the state’s already fragile ecosystems and natural resources. 



Our Role 



The good news is that with support from MARTI and its partner the Asociación Amigos de Sian Ka’an (ASK), and municipal, state and federal authorities, strict environmental criteria have at last been integrated into Quintana Roo’s Local Ecological Use Programs (Spanish acronym POEL).The POELs have adopted recommendations from the Guide to Planning, Design, and Sustainable Construction in the Mexican Caribbean developed by MARTI in 2012. These criteria include promoting more efficient resource use through improved technologies, conducting wind studies, strengthening the stewardship of mangroves and aquifers, providing better wastewater treatment, and ensuring that new buildings take into account the increased risk of extreme weather events resulting from climate change.“There are two key areas in the POELs where MARTI is having a strong impact,” said Gonzalo Merediz, executive director of ASK. “Firstly, by taking into account groundwater in development planning, this is something that wasn’t done before in Quintana Roo. Secondly, by ensuring that buildings have better wastewater treatment systems, which is essential for halting damage to the coral reef.”Through MARTI, greater emphasis has also been placed on the need to care for the many lagoons, aquifers and underground rivers that supply most of Quintana Roo’s freshwater. These resources are highly vulnerable to human pollution because soils in the area come from carbonate rocks (karst terrain) that allow easy infiltration of contaminants. Constructing over these aquifers poses a high risk of building collapse.As for water treatment, MARTI and its partners worked to ensure all new buildings are connected to wastewater treatment plants. They also promoted stricter indicators for water treatment to ensure reductions in the amounts of nitrates and phosphates, which end up in the sea and cause algal blooms that destroy the coral reef.Ecological land use planning for the municipalities of Othón P. Blanco (the largest in the state), Solidaridad and Benito Juárez (the two most developed) already have environmental criteria proposed by MARTI. The POEL for Othón P. Blanco was exceptionally successful, because a low-density development plan linked to ecotourism with environmental indicators stricter than those currently required by current national regulations for water treatment was approved.“This is a great achievement because the contributions of MARTI and the environmental organizations working on the initiative are now included in legally binding instruments for compliance. We are confident that they will make a big difference to the sustainable development of Quintana Roo,” said José Funes, delegate of the Ministry of Environment and Natural Resources (Spanish acronym SEMARNAT).

Puerto Natales Recycling Project,"Since 2015, the Torres del Paine Legacy Fund, a travel philanthropy fund established by Sustainable Travel International in partnership with the Fink Family Foundation, has provided over $6,000 in grant funding to the Municipality of Puerto Natales to install the town’s first permanent recycling system.Located in Chilean Patagonia, the city of Puerto Natales is the gateway to Torres del Paine National Park. Puerto Natales is home to 20,000 people; however, park visitation results in an additional 200,000 visitors flowing through the city annually. This population generates a substantial amount of waste. As tourist numbers continue to rapidly grow, there is an ever increasing need for waste reduction and waste management solutions in the surrounding community.Historically, all of Puerto Natales’ waste has either been found scattered throughout the streets or piling up in the ever-expanding landfill on the outskirts of town. Fortunately, this all began to change in 2010 when the owners of Erratic Rock hostel, a mainstay for backpackers passing through Puerto Natales, decided to address the town’s waste management problems. Motivated by a desire to preserve the local wilderness and improve conditions for both residents and visitors, Erratic Rock took action towards developing a recycling solution.Despite the lack of a formal infrastructure, Erratic Rock began to organize regular recycling days each week within their own business community to collect recyclable materials. These initial efforts were funded by Erratic Rock along with grant funding provided by Patagonia, Inc. through their 1% for the Planet contribution. When enough materials were collected to fill a shipping container, the container was added to existing cargo headed weekly on a ferry to Puerto Montt, home of the closest recycling facility, over 2,000 kilometers north.Due to the success of this movement, the Municipality of Puerto Natales (MuniNatales) agreed to assume management of the operation in 2014. Although the transition provided increased local capacity for its continued success, the operation lacked the resources for expansion into a permanent infrastructure for the city. Erratic Rock continued to receive the grant funding from Patagonia through 1% for the Planet until the program was discontinued in 2014.This is when the Legacy Fund stepped in to support the Puerto Natales Recycling Project. The initial grant provided by the Legacy Fund allowed MuniNatales to purchase five containers to act as clean points, or “puntos limpios.” These containers were distributed throughout the town for residents to dispose of their recycling. The effort was expanded when BORSI, a German thermoplastic processing company, agreed to sponsor the purchase of ten more containers. Every week, the material collected from the containers is transported to a collection center on the outskirts of town. The materials are then sorted and compacted by employees of Recipat, a local recycling company based in Punta Arenas. Once sufficient material is collected, everything is shipped via truck or boat to recycling centers in Puerto Montt and Santiago.The “puntos limpios” are only the beginning of a more sustainable future for the community of Puerto Natales. With this small infrastructure in place, education and awareness-building are needed to promote the recycling system to the town’s residents and businesses. As the program continues to expand and recycling becomes a common practice for everyone in the town, the long-term plan is to develop a modern recycling facility in Puerto Natales that will service the entire Magallanes region.Tourism will continue to grow in Torres del Paine National Park and the surrounding region. With this growth, it becomes increasingly important for the area to have systems in place to be able to manage the influx of people and the waste that they create.Learn more about Sustainable Travel International’s efforts in and around Torres del Paine National Park.

Promoting tourism in Namibia’s communal conservancies,"Capturing the North American tourist market to alleviate rural poverty and support local conservation efforts in Namibia. 



Where & Why 



Located along the Atlantic Ocean in Southern Africa, Namibia spans over 800,000 square kilometers of natural and cultural diversity. Namibia’s resident population is made up of at least 11 different ethnic groups, resulting in a rich mix of heritage and traditions. Unfortunately, a large percentage of Namibia’s rural indigenous population lives in poverty due the country’s history of apartheid and the resulting income inequality. The country’s geography varies greatly, from sand dunes and rugged mountains to tropical rainforests and savannahs. These landscapes host a high number of endemic species, making wildlife conservation a crucial focus.Namibia was the first country in the world to specifically address habitat conservation and the protection of natural resources in its constitution. This led to the establishment of 82 communal conservancies – defined geographic areas within which the local residents are responsible for the protection of the wildlife and other natural resources. Residents are also given rights over tourism operations and development within the conservancy boundaries. This means the local people are more likely to be engaged in and receive the benefits from tourism. The influx of tourists to communal conservancies combats Namibia’s high rural poverty levels by stimulating rural community development, creating new job opportunities, generating alternative income streams, and providing new skills and expertise.Communal conservancy tourism also fosters sustainable management of natural resources and stimulates cultural preservation. Because Namibia’s most compelling tourism assets are the native wildlife and cultural heritage, local communities now associate these natural resources with increased economic benefits and place a greater value on conservation efforts. This has resulted in decreased poaching, the successful restoration of native species such as black rhinos, lions, cheetahs and zebras, and the ongoing revitalization of cultural traditions.Of course, the success of economic development and conservation efforts within Namibia’s communal conservancies is highly contingent on the prosperity of the country’s tourism industry. While Namibia enjoyed steady tourism growth during the decade after its Independence in 1990, the economic recession in the years following led to a decline in tourist arrivals from the country’s traditional European source markets. With every tourist signifying an opportunity for poverty alleviation and resource conservation, this decrease in arrivals represented an impending threat to the well-being of Namibian communities. 



Our Role 



To combat the decline in European tourist arrivals and spur sustainable tourism development, Sustainable Travel International joined Cardno, a professional infrastructure and environmental services company, and other partners to implement the North American Destination Marketing (NADM) Project. The project was funded by the Millennium Challenge Account (MCA) – Namibia on behalf of the Namibia Tourism Board.The NADM project aimed to diversify Namibia’s source markets by attracting more travelers from the United States and Canada and increasing the number of tour operators who sell Namibia. Achieving this tourism growth would mean greater benefits for local people and communities engaged in tourism, particularly those living in rural poverty, including:Greater local employment and economic gain from increased foreign engagement with Namibian festivals and eventsIncreased local capacity and skill-setEnhanced appreciation and conservation of Namibia’s natural and cultural heritageIncreased social cohesivenessEnhanced national and community prideCultural enrichment and broader social outlook through increased interaction with other people, ideas and culturesThe project took the form of a destination marketing campaign implemented over the course of four years. The campaign promoted Namibia as an exciting new destination, with added emphasis on conservancy-based tourism. Sustainable Travel International led the Festivals and Events component of the campaign. STI’s work focused on increasing the quality and recognition of Namibian festivals and events as well as communicating the essence of the destination by offering compelling, authentic stories. Our efforts included:Capacity building workshops for locals focused on festival / event planning, marketing, and how to meet the needs of North American travelersDevelopment of educational resources for Namibian event plannersRelaunch of Namibia’s Ae//Gams Arts and Cultural Festival in 2014Targeted outreach to travel trade, PR and strategic business networksEvent promotion through North American marketing and media channelsPromotion of Namibia as a prime destination for North American event plannersOur work, along with other project components, contributed to the ultimate success of the campaign. There are now 141 new North American companies selling Namibia and North American tourist arrivals grew from 19,342 at the beginning of the project to 28,787 in 2014. There are also 158 new itineraries to Namibia, many of which are specifically focused on communal conservancy tourism.While these achievements are considerable, the impact of this project extends far beyond the numbers. The resulting prosperity in Namibia’s tourism industry signifies additional economic opportunities and improved quality of life for people living in rural poverty as new jobs are created, foreign money flows into the local economy, and sustainable development is made possible.  Additionally, the growth in conservancy based tourism heightens the perceived value of wildlife, habitats, cultural traditions and local heritage as prized assets, ensuring that conservation efforts continue to be a top priority.
