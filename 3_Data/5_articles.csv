Sustainable Travel post-COVID-19? How the pandemic could produce lasting travel lessons.,"After a mere quarter of a year, these two words, these two things have become synonymous with one another, as one’s ability to move freely has become severely curbed worldwide. And yet, variations do exist between the different forms, the different styles of travel. And the extent to which they have been or will likely continue to be influenced by the longer-term implications of the coronavirus. Eventually, conventional, mainstream travel will restart, as the global economy attempts to reignite – though changes will be introduced, ranging from ‘digital health passports’ or automation and biometrics. But what of other forms like sustainable or more responsible travel? COVID-19 could be the very opportunity to make them and their principles the norm. Understanding the impact of COVID-19 An empty Italian town. Photo by M. R. on Unsplash The impact of the coronavirus upon travel is unprecedented, much like the use of that word nowadays. Jokes aside, it is difficult to accurately depict the impact COVID-19 is having on transport, most notably on international travel. Numerous airlines have either collapsed or are seeking bailouts from their governments to ensure they do not do so. The effects from COVID-19 are worse than two of the worst previous events on aviation combined –9/11 and the 2010 Icelandic volcanic eruption. Comparatively, the growth of remote working and telecommuting has meant users of public transport are at an all-time low – New York subway passengers are down by 90%. And that is in the entirety of its history of existence. Indeed, it is reasonable to think that over the summer, aspects of travel as we know them will normalise. But airports will be heavily monitored. Train and bus stations will remain affected by the current social distancing measures found in any public forum. Things will only reach relative normalisation levels once a remedy; a vaccine can not only be established but consistently mass-produced. However, when concerning sustainable travel, ecotourism, or related industries, predicting how resilient and adaptable they will be is very uncertain. Additionally, when considering environmentalism more broadly, the most apparent transformation has been with people’s reliance upon nature and their desire to seek solace within it during these times of hardship. But its this seemingly minor attitude adjustment that could yield far-reaching effects. How might COVID-19 reframe attitudes to travel? Airport terminal. Photo by Arie Wubben on Unsplash Before COVID-19, a National Geographic survey found that around 53% of interviewees would not be able to incorporate methods or options to make their travels less environmentally impactful. And why? One simple reason: cost. Often enough, sustainable travel, as it is currently perceived, is nearly universally correlated with higher costs. Indeed, this is something this writer appreciates, as trying to live as an ex-pat and work internationally. That said, it doesn’t have to be. Increasingly, as technology advances and people develop innovative products or services, they are giving people greater autonomy over their travel, which in turn, enables them to be more responsible. And, often enough, the most straightforward steps don’t involve anything specific at all, only needing to apply more significant awareness. Yet, it’s precisely due to COVID-19 that the most prominent outcome could be increased awareness among individual travellers. Simply because, with more tourists taking steps to be aware of their hygiene or interaction in public, this is will more likely then translate into all areas of decision-making. Decisions which then include their behaviour surrounding their frequency or style of travel. As mentioned, people’s appreciation for nature has exploded under COVID-19 alongside enjoying their local environments. So, as lockdown measures gradually ease, travellers will prioritise their own native countries as destinations to explore and holiday. And this means a twofold advantage: And that is without even mentioning the reduction in carbon emissions which will also occur, as travellers emphasise local destinations because of a stronger connection to them. Why this is more about adaptation than transformation People trying to social distance at the beach. Photo by engin akyurt on Unsplash What that fancy subtitle means is that the COVID-19 outbreak doesn’t need to mean a complete and ‘scary’ transformation of our lives when we travel. Inevitably, accommodating changes to how one travels for leisure or work will be necessary, perhaps resulting from other major global events such as terrorism. However, gradually these changes have become less severe as innovations have appeared, and people collectively adapt. The goes for sustainable travel post-COVID-19. Being able to travel freely temporarily, but sharply restricted has come as a shock. The pandemic has served a reminder of how much of a luxury travel can be, while also highlighting the importance of getting as much out from each experience as possible. But it has also emphasised the availability of options travellers actually have, including with making simple, conscious choices to when, where or how they travel. Indeed, both the UNWTO and WHO are using COVID-19 as the opportunity to redefine how tourism should be approached. To ensure an adequate lasting response to the coronavirus, they are treating this to promote responsible travel and that it will merely, benefit the wellbeing of individuals or their fellow travellers, but the broader climate and environment. Travel has the potential to benefit everyone. The travellers themselves, the recipients, and the whole environment, because of the ability to develop intercultural understandings of the globe’s diversity. It also means we are all more empathetic, which ensures we take care of each other and our surroundings. So, ironically, COVID-19 could be the very wakeup call we have needed to start living greener lives, travelling more responsibly and make more conscious, informed decisions. As by being more informed, we all become more empowered, resulting in a truly comprehensive change for sustainable travel.

"Quintana Roo, Mexico pushes for sustainable tourism","Quintana Roo aims at being known for more than a hotel zone. Over the past few years Quintana Roo, the Mexican state most known for cities like Cancun and Cozumel, has been touted as an up-and-coming ecotourism destination. Though, it is hard to ignore the voracious development of the hotel/ resort industry and the toll it takes on the region’s coastal ecosystem. What was once an underdeveloped area is now a booming tourism market with effects that range from, water pollution and coastal erosion to mangrove deforestation and endangered species. The large scale development of hotels that sit right along the coast has become a major attraction for visitors and it’s not hard to see why! Who doesn’t want to enjoy the pure, turquoise waters and sandy white beaches that Quintana Roo has to offer? But all-inclusive resorts are notorious for creating large amounts of waste, sometimes as much as 6kg per guest, per night [1]! The good news is, the local government has teamed up with several tour operators to create experiences that are genuinely supporting the environment, community, wildlife, and culture. This doesn’t entirely curb the overdevelopment of the hotels in the area but there is a concerted effort from the secretary of tourism to strike a balance and push for “zones of sustainable tourism development.[2]” For now, these pockets of development come in the form of changes in land usage and activities that highlight the preservation of natural resources. Rio Secreto Our group getting ready to venture down into the cave. Photo courtesy of Rio Secreto. Exploring Cenotes (underground sinkholes) has become one of the most exciting and sought after activities in the Riviera Maya and with good reason! Many are drawn to visit Cenotes in equal parts because of their cultural significance and their high adventure factor. The ancient Maya considered the caves sacred passages to the underground and the caves were sometimes used for sacrificial purposes. Nowadays, guests can dive, swim, rappel, and spelunk in Cenotes with a local tour operator or guide. One such place to do so and Green Suitcase Travel’s recommendation is Rio Secreto, a magical underground river in Quintana Roo. Rio Secreto stands out from other Cenote tours in the area for its environmental and social responsibility efforts. The company is a 100% Mexican-owned and operated and donates a significant percentage of their ticket sales towards safeguarding the conservation of the region’s water, fauna, and flora. Proceeds also go towards educational programs like Centinelas del Agua A.C (Water Sentinels). Guests of the park are also asked to wear no sunscreen or bug repellant to support the integrity of the water. The natural reserve features 1km of cave system to wade through while observing and learning about the geological formations within the cave. The inside of the underground cave system at Rio Secreto. Photo courtesy of Rio Secreto. Upon arrival, you are given all the equipment you need to explore the caves safely. After you’ve shimmied into a wetsuit and secured your helmet (provided by the park), guests are taken the mouth of the cave. Before entering, a Maya Shaman blesses the group and performs a ritual to cleanse any impurities before entering—a sign of respect for the Mayan culture. Once inside the cave, a specialized guide navigates the group through the cool, crystal clear waters. One of the most magical moments of the journey is when the guide asks all the guests to turn off their headlamps, lay back in the water, and enjoy the peace and quite the cave provides. After it’s all said and done, the tour ends with a delicious buffet and a chance to relax in some hammocks before taking off on your next great adventure. While there are some slippery parts (it is an underground cavern after all), the tour is suitable for folks of all ages and activity levels. Isla Contoy Responsible Tourism in Isla Contoy. Photo by Misty Foster. Picture the most pristine, sunk-kissed island you can think of! The type of island you’d see from an aerial shot at the beginning of archeological-based, adventure film. That lush, picturesque island is Isla Contoy. While neighboring sister islands Isla Mujeres and Isla Holbox are better known, Contoy is fast becoming a contender for a special slice of paradise in Quintana Roo. What makes Isla Contoy different is that it’s not inhabited, save a handful of Biologists actively working to study and preserve the island’s flora and fauna. The virgin island is a natural paradise unspoiled by development and over-tourism, where you can enjoy island life to its fullest. There is a cap of 200 visitors per day that can access the island. The hope is that by managing the number of visitors, the efforts will not only prevent ecological damage due to human interaction but also provide education on why it is important to be a responsible visitor. Keeping the integrity of the island’s ecosystem is a key component of allowing tourists to enjoy it. The guardians of the island have taken special care to create a mostly zero-waste experience. There are only compost toilets on the island and guests are encouraged to not wear any (not even biodegradable) sunscreen but to opt for a rash guard instead. There is also no plastic policy. One of the only buildings on the island is a pavilion with fun information on the history of the region and info on the type of native critters you might see. And you will see wildlife! Isla Contoy is a wildlife haven, so don’t be surprised if you spot a slaughter of Iguanas roaming around. Iguana family chilling on Isla Contoy. Photo by Misty Foster. One interesting tidbit of note for nature enthusiasts is that an invasive species of spiders are eating the palm trees on the island. Local scientists discovered a way to combat this issue by vaccinating the trees using a special Mayan plant that makes the tree less sweet which is what the spiders are attracted to. Fighting nature with nature! A visit to Isla Contoy is a quick 30-minute boat ride from Cancún we recommend working with the folks who operate the vessel, The Asterix. Alltournative Mayan Mural at Alltournative’s Snorkle Native Park. Photo by Misty Foster. The Mesoamerican Barrier Reef, also known as the Great Mayan Reef, is home to 65 species of stony coral and around 500 species of fish. The reef stretches from Isla Contoy all the way down to Belize and Honduras. For divers and snorkelers alike, it’s one of the most biodiverse places in the world to experience marine life. While the reef is heavily protected, in recent years an influx of snorkeling and diving tours has If snorkeling is high on your bucket list, Alltournative’s Snorkel Native Park should be your go-to responsible tourism choice. The company is part of a project to rebuild the coral reefs through a process called fragmentation, which consists of breaking the coral into smaller polyps which helps stimulate tissue growth at a faster rate. The coral nursery run by Alltournative isn’t open to the public but it’s a noble effort being put forth by the company to do their part to ensure that the reef is around for visitors to enjoy for generations to come. Should you go snorkeling with Alltournative they will ask you to wear no sunscreen due to the toxicological effects it has on coral bleaching. The company is very transparent about their social and environmental policies and work closely with Maya communities to “reach social and economic development but also to prevent logging and hunting in the areas visited by tourists through excursions in the Riviera Maya and Yucatan.” They released an impressive and detailed sustainability report and are EarthCheck certified.

You’ve heard of overtourism. Here’s why undertourism is just as important.,"While some destinations are struggling to handle the side effects of overtourism, other destinations aren’t getting enough tourism. Here’s why undertourism matters, too. The gates of Dubrovnik, Croatia’s walled medieval center define ‘bottleneck’ as I’ve never experienced before. Roped-off sidewalk lanes defined narrow swathes of territory for those entering or fleeing the city. The boardwalk stretched to Yellowstone National Park’s Grand Prismatic Spring feels more like a queue than a path. There are more tourists than residents in Venice, Italy at any given moment. Overtourism has made travel headlines for a couple of years now. The buzz has pushed conscious travelers to do their part by traveling in the off-season, shopping local, or taking a wide berth around cities sagging with the weight of so many Canon Rebels and supportive walking shoes (though if that’s your thing, go for it!). This year, Skift declared a growing trend on the opposite side of the coin: undertourism. Planeta defines the phenomenon simply, as “inadequate levels of tourism.” While some cities grapple with overcrowded streets, others are actively seeking tourists. Increasingly, destinations capitalize on undertourism as a benefit — like Norway’s 2017 proclamation to “[rescue] weary travelers from overcrowded European cities [by] flying them to Oslo.” Even Nebraska got in on the undertourism action, boldly proclaiming “Honestly, it’s not for everyone” on ads and billboards across the state. Undertourism can be twisted to attract tourists who prefer uncrowded, unspoiled destinations. Nebraskan plains. Photo by Unsplash. Other places lack the marketing budget to tout their wide open spaces. Spending money to get money is easier said than done in regions where the tourism industry has fizzled thanks to natural disasters or political turmoil. Others struggle to attract travelers due to terrorism or high crime rates. The bright side of undertourism? It’s a chance for travelers to plot paths where their dollars (or pounds or Euros or …) make a real difference. Though I hesitate to write off Venice, Manhattan, or Bali as ‘spoiled,’ travelers looking for authentic experiences could do better for themselves — and their destinations! — by taking the proverbial road less traveled. Being a mindful, sustainable traveler is important no matter where you go. But in places dealing with undertourism, your choices make a greater difference. Why not spread the wealth?  If you’re heading to a less popular city, here’s my advice: Let’s do better this time around, traveling with purpose by shopping local, leaving places better than we found them, taking time to ask permission, then returning with our stories that encourage other travelers to do the same. Not sure where to begin? Get started here, with a short list of “undertourist-ed” destinations from fellow travel writers: Lombok, Flores, Sumba, Indonesia Sumba, Indonesia. Photo by Jeremy Bishop. Traveller writer Kylie McLaughlin admitted Indonesia’s need for tourists is startling considering how popular Bali is among vacationers and digital nomads. But Bali is only one island. And Indonesia’s archipelago has a population of “260 million” scattered across islands still “undiscovered by tourists.” Writer Barbara Ali describes Lombok: “This beautiful tropical island is like Bali was 40 years ago- waterfalls, beautiful beaches, greenery everywhere.” Fellow travel writer Ilona Biro said Flores and Sumba have similar appeals. Western Mongolia Photo courtesy of Aubrey Menarndt Writer Aubrey Menarndt says traveling to undermarketed destinations makes her journeys feel like she is discovering something new. Hiking in Mongolia’s Bayan-Olgii provided such an adventure. “In the still-deep snow of late May, my friend and I summited a peak to view the intersection of China, Russia, and Mongolia. The only being we encountered on our way was a trustworthy mountain dog who motivated and kept us company in exchange for snacks,” she said. The Golden Eagle Festival takes place yearly in the same region. Algeria Camels in Algeria. Photo courtesy of Unsplash. Travel writer and photographer Caroline Santina Lupini recommends Algeria, which she explored for three weeks in 2018. The country remains far less crowded than nearby Spain or Insta-famous Morocco. “It’s a lovely country,” Lupini says. “Great food, incredible hospitality, and amazing Roman ruins among other things to visit. Also pretty inexpensive. The only downside is that a visa is required for Americans.” Lviv, Ukraine Lviv, Ukraine. Photo by Pixabay. From 2007 to 2017, the number of international tourists visiting Ukraine dropped by about a third. Amy Hornsby visited Lviv in October and appreciated the inexpensive, Eastern European vibe similar to increasingly popular cities like Prague and Budapest. There were “main squares with cobbled walking areas, old-school trams, beautifully architectured churches, and plenty of cafes and bars scattered around,” she said. Jodphur, India Jodhpur, Rajasthan, India. Photo by Wikipedia. Travel writer Lola Méndez recommends slowing down to spend more time in cities made famous by one specific attraction. “Many people just pass through to see the blue walls but miss historic sites that need tourism dollars for restoration,” she explains. “Travelers would be amiss to not explore the cultural heritage sites in Jodhpur beyond the well-kept Mehrangarh Fort and baby blue walls of the old city. Spend a few extra days in town to explore the many markets and pay a visit to the stunning Jaswant Thada mausoleum. The white marble funerary monument has similar stone inlay adornments to the Taj Mahal with absolutely none of the crowds. The structure has been used as the cremation grounds for the royal Marwar family. Be sure to arrive in the late afternoon so you can catch the sunset from the hilltop–you’ll see the rolling hills of the Thar desert to one side and the ancient town of Jodhpur to the other.” Tirana, Albania Tirana, Albania. Image by GjataErvin on Pixabay Travel writer and digital nomad Steffani Cameron noted that Albania as an emerging European destination. She says, “Tirana, Albania has some great history in the outlying lands, is moving toward a cycling infrastructure, has food that is a mix of Italian, Greek. and Turkish. The people are great and the prices are low.” Georgia Tbilisi, Georgia. Photo by Wikipedia Commons. Luxury travel writer Nicole Trilivas says, “The country of Georgia — with fresh, punchy cuisine; fairy-tale architecture; and an ancient natural wine-making heritage — is criminally underrated. The locals are so kind and open to tourists, and I really hope it becomes more popular.” Sarah Grunwald, the owner of Taste Georgia, said the “crossroads culture” welcomes visitors from all over the world. She added that the capital, Tbilisi, has a synagogue, Orthodox Christian church, and a mosque within two blocks of each other. Grunwald noted that though Tbilisi gets a “fair share of tourists,” areas outside the city are still rugged and unexplored. Keep in mind, this is the short list. Undertourism affects destinations as remote as St. Helena and as near to popular destinations as Abruzzo and tiny inland towns of Puglia, Italy. Then there’s Puerto Rico, welcoming tourists after Hurricane Maria, and El Salvador, which is what travel writer Johanna Reed calls “the exact opposite of what’s being portrayed in the news.” Puerto Rico. Photo by Robert Ruggiero. For purposeful travelers, undertourism is an opportunity to be mindful. Explore somewhere new. Be surprised by the sights and experiences you haven’t had before. And as always, be respectful of your destination and its culture. Happy travels! Ready to visit one of these undertourist-ed areas? Contact us to plan a sustainable trip!

"This eco-lodge, deep in the jungles of Bali, should be on your radar","Tucked away on the slopes of Mount Batukaru, is a virtually untouched slice of paradise known as Sarinbuana Eco-Lodge. The quiet and soulful lodge is a welcome retreat for anyone looking for a reprieve from the hectic pace of Ubud or Canggu. The journey to the eco-sanctuary is long (and unpaved) but once you arrive, you might get so lost in the beauty of your surroundings that you forget where you are! The lush jungle, the biodiversity, the slower pace of life- there’s a lot to love about a stay at Sarinbuana. Fair warning, if you are looking to be “in the middle of it all,” this isn’t the place for you. But if you are interested in exploring a more authentic side of Bali, you’ll find plenty to experience and enjoy. The beauty and uniqueness of Sarinbuana are enhanced only by its sweet origin story. Owners Norm and Linda vant Hoff originally happened across the small mountain town when visiting during their honeymoon. They loved the area so much they decided to build a private home there. With the consent and help from the locals, the vant Hoff’s began to plant seeds and create roots for what would blossom into Sarinbuana Eco Lodge. “No electricity, No spoken english, No sealed roads. Surrounded by nature and nurtured by a few local subsistence farming families.Our land had only coconut trees and grasslands for Bali cows.”- The vant Hoff’s. Having been to Bali once before and primarily exploring the more populated areas, I was craving a different experience. I was so pleased with my time at the lodge because the remote eco-paradise provided an immersive nature experience, amazing food, and a chance to experience a more authentic side of Bali. At Green Suitcase Travel our goal is to bring you the best accommodations and experiences we find that have a positive impact on the destination. Here’s why Sarinbuana fits into our criteria for a top-notch place to stay when in Bali, Indonesia. Garden to table meals One of the highlights of my time at the lodge was the food! It was hands down the best food I ate on my entire trip in Bali. Every dish was colorful, jam-packed with nutritious goodness, and used all local flavors and ingredients. My personal favorite was Nasi Goreng, which is a traditional Balinese rice dish. Commitment To Sustainability Everything about the lodge has been carefully planned and thought out to reflect the values of the vant Hoff’s. They believe that environmental and social sustainability should be an integral part of any hospitality establishment. In fact, they offer eco-consulting for other businesses in Bali and their practices are open source. They also don’t use the word “eco” lightly- with full knowledge of how many establishments use the word as a greenwashing tool. For the vant Hoff’s and staff, being an eco-lodge means being fully integrated with the Natural, Built and Social Environments. Each of the five bungalows and the entire property is built in a way that supports these beliefs. Community Driven Activities During my time at Sarinbuana eco-lodge, I enjoyed participating in their morning yoga and meditation practice. The stunning, bamboo yoga palapa overlooks the jungle canopy, which instantly calms and uplifts your mood. In addition to daily yoga, guests can arrange a number of off-site hikes and treks, as well as on-site massages and cooking classes. The lodge also offers an array of cultural experiences like how to learn wood carving, language classes, how to make ceremonial offerings, and even how to play local instruments like the Rendik. Each excursion or private workshop serves as a way to fully immerse yourself in the local culture and is supports the community and their traditions. If you don’t want to leave the property, there’s plenty of ways to enjoy a relaxing day on-site. The lodge sits right next to a rice terrace and there is a waterfall and natural pools, you can soak in. The trek down from the lodge to the natural pool is serene and captivating. Staying at Sarinbuana eco-lodge is a truly magical experience, one that any eco-conscious traveler should consider when visiting Bali. The beauty of the property invites you to enjoy a more relaxed and balanced pace of life.

It’s no wonder many love and choose to travel during the fall, as it’s an ideal time to enjoy hiking, camping, fishing, and other outdoor activities! This is especially true in the Southwestern, United States where the warm weather lingers late into the year and the National Parks are less crowded.

Nimble’s ethical tech for the on-the-go traveler,"Technology powers our world. We depend on it to stay engaged, informed, and productive. Used with the right intentions, technology can be a force for good. Our devices allow us to stay connected to those we love and give us an outlet to creatively express our ideas. Through video and photography, we’re able to document stories that evoke a powerful, emotional response and remind us of our humanity. The #metoo and #blacklivesmatter movements have shown us that through communication technology, we can mobilize around issues that matter and make our voices heard. But if we want to continue on this path, we need to take a look at the consumptive costs technology exacts. Why a move towards ethical tech is necessary The energy use and production of technology come at a high cost for the environment. Pollution from electronics releases toxins that leach into the soil, water, and atmosphere. An estimated 41.8 million tons of e-waste (electronic waste) are produced each year. And while most of it is recyclable, only 15-20% is done so properly. But it’s not just how electronics are disposed of that raises an issue, it’s how they are created, to begin with. Many electronics are made with plastics, heavy metals, and flame retardants. These materials can be hazardous and often aren’t biodegradable. So when they end up in a landfill, it’s contributing to an already dangerous waste problem. Then there’s the issue of energy consumption. The process for making these devices is laborious and can involve between 5 and 50 factories for their sourcing and production. Consequently, manufacturing and using electronics takes a huge toll on the environment and on human health. If you’re reading this from your computer or smartphone, thinking “well, I might as well go live in a cave!” don’t get your pelts just yet! We live in a world that depends on electronic devices to maintain work and relationships. But we also live in a world where ethical and sustainably made technology is here and ready to change the game. Nimble: ethical-tech for sustainable travelers Sponsored by Nimble As a travel planner, I focus on incorporating sustainability into my adventures. I’m always on the lookout for ways to embrace a low-impact lifestyle. For me, that includes the gear I buy and carry with me. Some of this is easy. In most places we can find clothes, backpacks, shoes, eating utensils, and camping gear that is ethically made. But when it comes to technology there aren’t as many options. Some innovators make eco-friendly phone cases and laptop carriers, but the pickins are otherwise slim. Needless to say, I was thrilled when I found out about the tech company, Nimble. Nimble’s line of portable and wireless battery chargers are an outstanding choice for on-the-go -travelers who want to keep their devices charged and stay connected with an ethically-made device. With the slogan: Tech for Good, Nimble is transforming the way electronics are made. The brand focuses on three tenets that help to move the industry toward better tech. Made with care From the internal structure of their gadgets to their plastic-free packaging, Nimble is committed to using better materials for their devices for a lower environmental impact. All of their portable power banks are made using plant-based bioplastics like corn and sugar cane, and recyclable aluminum. Using these renewable materials means the device will break down easier over time, once it’s lived out its life cycle. Nimble has also incorporated a signature speckled texture on their chargers. The texture is derived from its the coating’s ingredients–mica and other naturally occurring materials like crystal. This gives the already sleek design a unique touch: no two patterns are ever the same on the chargers. Perhaps one of the most impressive initiatives of the company is their one-to-one tech recovery program. Nimble will responsibly recycle up to a pound of your personal e-waste in a pre-paid return envelope that they include with your purchase. All you have to do is collect your unused cords, phones, etc., and send it off to them! The perfect gift for sustainable travelers If you’re looking for a unique gift for the sustainable traveler in your life, this is a great option (it will fit nicely in those stockings too!). While the stylish design and quality build of Nimble’s devices may be their initial draw, their power capacity is equally impressive. Depending on your needs, Nimble offers 10000-28000 mAh capacity chargers. They also sell wireless stands, USB chargers, a travel kit, and other accessories. At GST we can’t wait to see what they develop next. We look forward to companies like Nimble becoming the industry standard. Nimble charges and accessories work for: Take advantage of their Black Friday deals and save up to 30% off on select items. Misty is the owner and founder of Green Suitcase Travel.

Guatemala is leading the way for community-based tourism in Central America,"There’s a lot happening in the small, mountainside town of San Cristóbal El Alto- a municipality of Antigua, Guatemala. The verdant locale has a birds-eye view of Mt. Agua, quaint coffee fincas, and shops filled with handmade goods. You will be won over by the kind-hearted residents. It has the kind of charming, unspoiled feel of the kind of place that would draw in Anthony Bourdain. Honest, natural, and teeming with life. Because of this, the rural village stands out as a model for community-based tourism. In fact, this October San Cristóbal El Alto hosted the 2018 Primer Encuentro Centroamericano de Turismo Comunitario (ECATC) conference. The event brought together community members and industry professionals from across Central America to create alliances, build strategy, and foster ideas to further sustainable tourism. The conference was pulsing with excitement as attendees brainstormed ways to conscientiously bridge the gap between travelers and burgeoning but fragile destinations. Since rural communities often have a high dependency on natural resources and place greater value on cultural traditions, exploring how tourism can sustain these territories is crucial. This is something Travolution, the organizers of ECATC, understand and work hard to promote. As a non-profit aimed at facilitating intercultural exchanges, Travolution organizes networking events such as ECATC and offers curated tours throughout South America. Their work highlights how indigenous tourism can transform the lives of the traveler and benefit the destination. To understand this better, one need only to look at the company’s “why” for how  tourism can be an effective tool for sustainable development. They find that tourism, done right: Though they don’t yet offer tours in Guatemala, Travolution plans to bring their touring services there eventually. It’s easy to see why when you look at the initiatives under way in this marvelous country. The community of San Juan la Laguna How community-based tourism is shaping the country When people think of Guatemala, the first thing that comes to mind is often coffee. Although coffee farms and agriculture are a staple of the country’s economy, community-based tourism is a close contender. Rural villages and cities in Guatemala are bringing cultural identity to the foreground of the tourism experience as a way to bolster the economic landscape. Guatemala, deemed the heart of the Mayan world, has a lot of culture to offer. The diversity of the land can be seen in its 21 languages, flavorful food, magnificent arts, and astounding folklore. Indigenous tribes make up 51% of the population. Within each tribe, different symbols and patterns tell a story of their traditions and identity. This is primarily seen in rich art and textiles, and especially in weaving. It’s also how some communities in Guatemala are using their heritage to tell a new story- one of empowerment and sustainability. Woven into the fabric of life Many of the women in Guatemala still wear the traditional dress, traje- which consists of a skillfully woven huipil (blouse), skirt and sash. The pattern of the huipil indicates what region and tribe the clothing are from. Each handmade garment is intricate, colorful, and can take up to a year to create. A woman, wearing her traje, weaving at the Santo Domingo Xenacoj cooperative For many of the Maya, the clothing is more than just a way to identify their region. It holds ancestral significance and ties them directly to their lineage. Specific patterns on the garments can indicate stature in the community and some are reserved for sacred events and ceremonies. In many ways, the huipil is the common thread throughout the tourism experience. The combination of geometric patterns, colors, animal and plant symbols appear in many forms and serve as a bright reminder of the richness of the culture. A woman wearing a huipil and other Mayan symbols depicted on a street mural These cities are leading the way for sustainability in Guatemala San Juan la Laguna This lakeside town is a must for any responsible traveler visiting the Lake Atitlán region. The colorful town is a boon for those who want to experience and support locally run initiatives. Supported by Planeterra, a community-led organization, Rupalaj Kistalin offers cultural exchange tours that preserve the heritage, people, and environment. Because the village is remote, job opportunities are limited and the much of the community relies on these programs for financial support. Through Posadas Mayas, or homestay programs, visitors can get a first-hand experience of life in the hamlet of San Juan la Laguna. There are 26 Tz’utujil families that have opened their homes to guests. Each host family will take in new guests each week and share their home and food. While the homestay experience provides a unique window into everyday life for the Tz’utujil, Rupalaj Kistalin also offers tours that feature textiles, medicinal plants, painting, and chocolate. When you buy a gift at many of these cooperatives, a significant portion of your purchase goes toward community projects and education. A highlight of the tour is the Gloria Cholotio Art Gallery and the Ixoq Ajkeem weaving demonstration center, where you can learn about the process of using natural dyes. San Pedro la Laguna Seven out of 26 municipalities in Guatemala have or are starting to implement a single-use plastics ban. This includes straws, styrofoam and plastic sacks. San Pedro la Laguna was the first on Lake Atitlán to take the lead! In 2015 the local government passed an ordinance moving toward environmental conservation. The city saw how polluted the lake was becoming due to plastics and decided that in order to preserve the natural beauty of the lake and attract more tourism, they needed to do something about it. What wasn’t an easy shift at first has now become a standard. Local residents were initially uninterested in making the switch because they thought it would cost too much, but the government visited each family and gave them tools to make the switch to a plastic-free life. Now everyone carries reusable bags and Tupperware to the street market. Santa Catarina Polopó Painted houses in Santa Catalina Polopo Art is a tool for change in the city of Santa Catarina Polopó. Another city in the Solola region near Lake Atitlán, Santa Catarina Polopó is a fishing village. In recent years the population has increased significantly, which has shifted the economic landscape. Traditional trades like fishing and agriculture are no longer a viable option. Many of the Maya Kakchikel families are being forced into extreme poverty because they can’t keep up with commerce and don’t have the necessary skills for a competitive job market. That’s where Pintanado Santa Catarina Polopó comes in. Built for the community, the organization aims to revitalize the town by making it a cultural destination through art. With the support of community leaders and volunteers, individual homes are painted with Mayan symbols. The organization expects that this  beautification will lead to more tourism and in turn, more investment opportunities, jobs, and publicity for indigenous arts. The project also allows families to reclaim their heritage through these symbols by giving them exposure. There are around 850 houses that are set to be painted by 2019. Each family chooses the base color, symbols, and secondary colors. The association then provides the painting materials and a locally-employed promoter, who ensures that the project is completed. The cherry on top? The paint is ecologically friendly! “The design starts from the idea that Santa Catarina is a large huipil that is drying on the mountain and that connects the lake with the sky of Atitlán.”- Pinatanado Santa Catarina Polopó El Paredón Surfing, sunshine, and sea turtles. El Paredón is a hidden gem on the Pacific coast of Guatemala. Still relatively unknown, the oceanside village is starting to gain tourism traction. This has caused some concern for the largely conservative population, who are deterred by the party hostels cropping up. However, the social enterprise La Choza Chula is working to ensure that the tourism boom doesn’t hurt the residents. The proceeds from Chula tours go towards funding education and environmental projects. They’ve set up a community garden and are teaching people how to grow their own food. They have also established a computer lab, a secondary school, and a library. This is extremely important when you consider that Guatemala has the lowest literacy rate in Latin America. La Choza Chula is also committed to providing jobs by hiring residents for guides and hosts. They offer homestays, turtle tours, cooking classes and more. El Paredon makes up 10% of all of Guatemala’s mangrove systems which are, unfortunately, being deforested. Because their biosystem is so fragile, the organization is working to change the local mentality and stress the importance of beach clean up and conservation. La Choza Chula in El Paredon The great news is that these examples are only a small taste of the Guatemalan movement towards sustainability. Companies like Guatepassport offer entire eco-friendly holidays, and even the Guatemalan tourism institute, INGUAT, is pushing for reform.
