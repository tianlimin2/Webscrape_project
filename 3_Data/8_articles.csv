Green Wedding: special places for a special day,"The island – a dropout’s place of longing. At least that’s how the often-quoted phrase “I’m ready for the island”, sung by Peter Cornelius in his 1981 hit, came about. Islands fascinate us. Far away from everything. Needing to cross the sea for anyone to reach you. Ideal for getting away from daily stress and responsibilities. However, sea levels are rising and many island paradises are likely to disappear in the coming decades. All the more reason why we as travelers shouldn’t rush to plan our next island getaway before it’s no longer possible. Instead, now is the time to take a hard look at what island vacations mean to our planet and how we can make them sustainable. Islands in peril: sea level rise and climate change The latest report from the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) focuses extensively on rising sea levels (GMSL = global mean sea level). It is caused by melting glaciers as a result of rising temperatures. (By the way, we discussed melting glaciers last week in this blog post.) Sea levels are already higher than they were in pre-industrial times. So, the question is not if, but how much the seas will rise? According to the ICPP report: “GMSL will rise between 0.43 m (0.29–0.59 m) and 0.84 m (0.61–1.10 m) by 2100”. However, experts also acknowledge that uncertainties in climate change-induced sea level rise increase significantly after 2050 due to uncertainties in emission scenarios. Studies show that a GMSL of 2m by 2100 cannot be ruled out. The Maldives and Other Endangered Islands The Maldives is the lowest country in the world. It consists of 26 atolls and over 1,000 coral islands in the middle of the Indian Ocean. According to Planet Wissen, their highest elevation is only 2.40 meters. If the sea level rises by 2 meters, the descendants of today’s Maldivians will have no land to live on. But water levels are not the only climate-related issue facing the Maldives: Tourism in the Maldives – Helping or adding to the problems? Tourists produce waste, and the buildings created for them often have a strong impact on nature. For example, in the name of “landscaping,” some islands are altered to better suit the hotel complex. Sand is piled up and reefs are dredged. The long-term impact on the local ecosystem (ocean currents, flora and fauna) is often unclear or ignored in such projects Nevertheless, tourism is vital to the Maldives as it is the main source of income. According to GIZ, the Maldives derives 90% of its tax and customs revenue from tourism. Sustainable tourism in Gilli Lankanfushi To ensure that tourism not only benefits the economy but also preserves nature, we believe it is essential to focus on sustainable tourism. Fortunately, more and more players in the industry see it that way – including those in the Maldives. We are pleased to introduce you to Gili Lankanfushi Resort, a sustainable Green Pearls® partner in the Maldives. The eco-luxury resort consists of 45 waterfront villas and is committed to protecting the environment in many ways. These efforts include eliminating plastic wherever possible, conserving water and energy, and sourcing local food. Gili Lankanfushi is also committed to its Maldivian employees (training and bus service) and the local school. The island-saving importance of coral reefs One hope for islands like the Maldives are their coral reefs. These reefs have the ability to grow with a slight rise in sea level. Furthermore, they act as breakwaters. The 2004 tsunami showed that where intact reefs and mangrove belts were present as a protective barrier, the devastation of the tidal wave was least severe. But the coral reefs themselves are at risk Their enemies include: You may have heard of coral bleaching. This phenomenon occurs when corals lose their color because they repel the different colored algae with which they actually form a community. It occurs when water temperatures get too high. Bleached corals do not necessarily die but are capable of regenerating when their environment returns to normal. Scientific research has shown this in the Great Barrier Reef (Australia). However, if the elevated water temperature persists, the corals will die. Speaking to Geo, coral researcher Professor Christian Voolstra says that global warming of 1.5C could kill around 70-90% of reefs. However, there is hope that corals may be able to adapt to higher temperatures. Currently, coral reefs have at least the strength to regenerate after being destroyed. Corals on Ko Phi Phi Leh recovered from mass tourism 90% of the coral off the Thai island of Ko Phi Phi Leh were damaged in 2018. Not because of climate change, but because of us tourists. The trigger was the Hollywood movie “The Beach”, in which the dropout Richard (played by Leonardo DiCaprio) finds his paradise – in “Maya Bay” on Ko Phi Phi Leh. As a result, the bay was closed to visitors in 2018. And after only 4 years (2022) many corals had recovered and reef sharks had returned. Zeavola Resort on Ko Phi Phi Leh supports reef development Ko Phi Phi Leh is about an hour’s speedboat ride from Phuket and is indeed a dreamy mix of fine white sand, tropical vegetation and turquoise waters. Our Green PearlsⓇ partner, Zeavola Resort, is committed to sustainable tourism and coral reef conservation. Over 10,000 coral fragments have already been replanted by Zeavola. In addition, the staff regularly cleans the beach and reefs of marine debris. The luxurious resort offers PADI scuba diving courses and the opportunity to experience the underwater world of the coral reefs for yourself. Trained divers (as opposed to party tourists) are generally not a threat to the reefs, but rather those who are committed to protecting nature. Is Phuket still an island? Some time ago we had a lively discussion in our team about whether Phuket is still an island when there are two car bridges connecting it to the mainland. Our final verdict: Yes, Phuket is still an island because the land is surrounded by sea – a car bridge doesn’t count! (Or do you disagree?) Sustainable holiday at Keemala in Phuket. The fact that islands are completely surrounded by water means that they are often more difficult to supply and many products have to be imported. Keemala “Villa Wonderland” in Phuket has created a large self-catering garden with fruits, vegetables, and herbs for the hotel kitchen. The resort’s cooking classes include a tour of the Thai plants. In addition, Keemala is part of the zero-waste movement and does not use single-use plastics throughout the resort. Canary Islands – Europe in front of Africa The Canary Islands are politically part of Spain and geographically part of Africa – they lie off the west coast of Africa. The islands have a mild and warm climate, beautiful beaches with bizarre rock formations, and a unique flora and fauna with many endemic plants and animals (which you can only find here). These include the Canary Island striped gecko. There are 8 Canary Islands: It is impossible to say which one is “the most beautiful”. They each have their own charm! How climate change threatens the Canary Islands In 2023, the Ministry of the Environment of the Canary Islands called for a forward-looking policy. The Teide National Park in Tenerife already shows signs of the consequences of climate change. Speaking at the 2023 Environment Forum in Gran Canaria, Environment Minister José Antonio Valbuena warned of the following developments due to climate change: Water and climate projects of Casa León Royal Retreat in Gran Canaria Fresh water is already scarce in the Canary Islands. Gran Canaria’s climate is also dry and there are no rivers or lakes. “Getting water is a vital problem,” reports Green PearlsⓇ Hotel Casa León Royal Retreat. The small 25-room boutique hotel is located in the interior of Gran Canaria. A 10,000-square-foot garden has been planted on the property with native, drought-resistant plants such as cacti, which naturally require little water. In addition, there is a rainwater harvesting system and a water treatment plant for potable water. Small signs in the bathrooms remind guests to conserve water and not to wash towels unnecessarily. In a further commitment to the global climate, the owner family has leased 40,000 hectares of forest in the Balkans. Sustainable vacation at the OCÉANO Health Spa Hotel in Tenerife On the Canary Island of Tenerife, the operators of the OCÉANO Health Spa Hotel are also committed to sustainability. The hotel uses filtered gray water from a local initiative to irrigate the grounds and flush the toilets. Local products are available, and for each guest who books through the Océano website, a tree is planted through the mountain forest project partner. Find out more about vacationing in Tenerife in this travel report. Getting to Sicily by train You don’t have to fly to the Italian island of Sicily. There is – get this – a train service to the island! The train rolls at Villa San Giovanni on a ferry and goes in Messina in Sicily back on the rail! However, public transportation on the island is very poorly developed. Most vacationers therefore rent a car locally. There is definitely a lot of work to be done in terms of transport sustainability. Our Green Pearls® partner, the ADLER Spa Resort SICILIA on the protected natural beach, is committed to sustainability. For an authentic experience of Sicily, the resort offers a “Village Experience”. You will visit the picturesque village of Catabellotta and learn about its thousand-year history. As a special, you have a tasting of the local Biancolilla olives and lunch at the home of a local family. Tips for a sustainable island getaway To conclude, let’s summarize how you can sustainably travel to the islands and what you can do to protect them: Can you think of other measures? Let us know in the comments. And at the end, let’s sing together: “I’m ready to protect the islands!” 🙂 Save the article for your next travel plans!"
Green Wedding: special places for a special day,"This is an update of our article from May 22, 2022 and contains current dates for cooking courses 2024 What is the best part for you when you are on vacation? For us, one of the most important things is definitely the food! Over the past years, self-cooking popularity has increased significantly. A survey by a German market research institute found that 41 percent of the respondents have been swinging their spoon since Corona more often. The three most significant nutritional aspects from the consumers’ perspective, this survey says, are: freshness of products (92%), healthy eating (81%) flavor and natural ingredients (81%). But one issue remains: Self-cooked food typically doesn’t come close to eating the real treats on vacation. To make sure you too can take a piece of your vacation home with you, several of our Green Pearls® partners host sustainable cooking classes. You can learn everything about regional cooking traditions. Genießerhotel Die Forelle: Slow Food and no imported goods The Genießerhotel Die Forelle on the Carinthian shores of Lake Weissensee in Austria has a special approach: Slow Food.

The hotel invites all cooking fans to weekly cooking classes with food coach and Ayurveda chef Gabriel Simon-Pinero. Gabriel traveled the world even as a child. Latin America, North Africa, Spain, Italy, and the South of France. He brought culinary knowledge and experience from each region. This knowledge is now available to you: with much joy and pleasure he teaches Ayurvedic cuisine, and the power of spices and herbs in his cooking classes.

Thai cooking at Zeavola Diving Resort Another Green Pearls® partner is the luxurious eco-resort Zeavola on the island of Koh Phi Phi (reachable by speedboat from Phuket). In addition to the diving school and snorkeling courses that will guide you through the corals and fantastic underwater world, you can also discover Thai cuisine. In groups of 2 to 6 people, you will first learn about typical Thai ingredients, spices and cooking methods while enjoying a cocktail or mocktail in a relaxed atmosphere. Then you prepare the dishes yourself under supervision. Dishes include Yum Nua Yang (spicy grilled beef salad), Tom Yum Kung (spicy shrimp soup with lemongrass and galangal) and Gang Kiew Wan Kai (green curry chicken with eggplant and basil). “Earth to Table” at Inkaterra Hacienda Urubamba in Peru “Earth to Table” (also known as “Farm to Table”) means that the ingredients are harvested, processed, and served directly on your plate.

You can book the pasta course exactly as you like, and in addition to vegetarian and vegan options, you can even prepare gluten-free pasta! Sicilian culture on your plate at the ADLER Spa Resort SICILIA The best way to get to know a country and its culture is through its food.

The 5 most beautiful eco-luxury hotels in the Alps,"Vacations are primarily about relaxing, recharging our batteries, and leaving everyday life behind. It is well known that nature has a great influence on our well-being and relaxation. Therefore, a vacation is even more valuable when we are surrounded by a beautiful landscape and can enjoy beautiful views. Hotel and wellness above the ocean Due to the year-round mild climate in the Canary Islands, the Océano Health Spa Hotel in Tenerife is the ideal place for a relaxing getaway. The location directly on the Atlantic Ocean and the wild mountains of the Anaga Mountains are the best environment for more vitality, health, and joy of life. In all rooms and suites of the hotel, you can enjoy the view of the sea and the wide ocean with its spectacular sunsets. On the eleventh floor of the hotel is the Rooftop Lounge OCEAN 11 with a large roof terrace. It offers spectacular views over the bay of Punta del Hidalgo and the Teide. Here you can relax at the end of the day and enjoy the sunset in the evening with an aperitif in your hand. For all yoga lovers, there is also that at the Océano Hotel with an impressive view over the ocean. In fact, you can do yoga on the roof terrace of the hotel. Various courses, as well as private classes for all levels, are offered and the sun and wind protection ensures that you feel completely comfortable on the roof terrace. Mountains as far as the eyes can see The Berghotel Rehlegg, which has been climate-positive since 2017, is particularly committed to sustainability and respect for the environment, people, and animals. The hotel contributes its climate-friendly contribution, without you having to compromise on enjoyment. In the middle of the mountains, you can not only relax but also enjoy the incredible view of the impressive landscape. The exclusive senior suites are located at the very top of the new guesthouse. Here you have a breathtaking view over Ramsau, the peaks of the Berchtesgaden National Park, and the Watzmann. And not only that, you can even sleep under the stars. On the 15 m² large and covered loggia there is a daybed, which can be converted into a “stargazer bed” in the evening. In cold seasons you will get additional heating blankets, cozy wool blankets, and extra warm bedding. Sleeping under the stars becomes an unforgettable experience here. A unique and magical place Located in the heart of the land of the Moroccan Berbers is the Toubkal National Park. Mount Toubkal is the highest mountain in North Africa and the entire Arab world.

The 5 most beautiful eco-luxury hotels in the Alps,"Many Green Pearls®’ partners support or initiate projects to ensure sustainable development in their region. This involves various topics such as environmental and animal protection, recycling projects, support for communities, and education and training of local people. At several Green Pearls® hotels, you can support these local projects, using your trip to raise awareness about important sustainability issues. Coral Lines Project – Planting corals at Gili Lankanfushi At Gili Lankanfushi in the Maldives, marine biologists have initiated a project to help regenerate coral reefs. The resort is a pioneer in sustainability in the Maldives. In this project, 50 coral fragments are tied to a rope and then left to grow on the seabed for at least a year. The next step is to transplant the corals grown to the house reef. If you feel like it, you are invited to join the marine biologists in connecting the corals to the rope. Each rope has an ID number and you can follow the growth of “your” coral lines every three months on the project blog. Rescue dogs and cats at Tongsai Bay The Tongsai Bay has been sustainably oriented since its beginning. Environmental protection and social action determine the philosophy of the owners. The resort supports the regional animal shelter with equipment and food and has also donated a minibus that is often in use. If you feel like adopting a dog or cat, you can choose one to become a sponsor. The sponsorship costs 20 euros per month. There are also German accounts to which donations can be transferred, as well as a receipt for the donation. Kasbah du Toubkal and education for all In many Moroccan rural regions, girls are denied schooling. This is also due to the lack of infrastructure. Schools are too far away and accommodation near the school is financially unaffordable for families. In order to help here, our partner hotel in Morocco, the Kasbah du Toubkal, has co-founded the initiative “Education for all” to enable precisely these girls to receive a school education. They receive free accommodation in the school’s own hostels near the school and can participate in education and thereby sustainably improve their standard of living in rural areas. According to the motto “Educate a boy and you educate the man; educate a girl and you educate a family, a community, a nation”, “Education for All” is committed to the school education of disadvantaged girls. The project is financed and made possible by the guests of the Kasbah du Toubkal, donations, and volunteers. They help the girls with their schoolwork and also teach French. Maybe you would like to apply as a volunteer. You can do so at info@efamorocco.org. Happy chickens at Berghotel Rehlegg Would you like to visit happy chickens? You can do that at the partner farm of Berghotel Rehlegg. Here at Haus Hohenfried in Bayerisch Gmain they live – the Augsburg chickens. As the name suggests, it is a Bavarian chicken breed that is under threat of extinction. In 2009, there were only a few left in Germany. In 2018, Berghotel Rehlegg bought 15 chickens and one rooster from a breeder near Augsburg. Since then, the female and male animals have been living in a barn with plenty of outdoor space and green areas for pecking. And unlike mass-produced chickens, which live only 30 days, or organic chickens, which live 80 days, Augsburg’s chickens are weatherproof and resilient and live at least 11 months. It is a so-called “Zwiehuhn” or dual-purpose chicken because it is an excellent source of eggs and meat. The animals of the hotel live appropriate to their species, their meat and eggs have Demeter quality and are of the best taste. Try it yourself! You can find even more projects of our partner hotels here. Read more: SUSTAINABLE TRAVEL IN THAILAND – GREEN INITIATIVES AND HOTEL PROJECTS Do you like the article? Share it!"
The 5 most beautiful eco-luxury hotels in the Alps,"Don’t you feel a strong connection to the universe when you look up at the starry sky? You realize that you are a small dot in a vast world. If so, you’re not alone. Booking.com predicts that one of the top vacation trends for 2025 will be nocturism. And since the best way to see the stars is without light pollution, nocturnal tourism is also linked to sustainability. You can learn more about this and find out which sustainable accommodations are ideal for star gazing here. PS: There will be three highlights in the sky in 2025. Tips for stargazing Get started without expensive equipment First of all, you don’t need expensive equipment to stargaze. A simple pair of binoculars will do. If you want to bring a flashlight, make sure it has a red light (hint: put a piece of red parchment paper in front of it). It takes about 30 minutes for the eye to fully adjust to the darkness. The red light makes the adjustment easier. Known constellations as help If you’re new to stargazing, it might help to compare it to exploring a new city. Large buildings and famous monuments help you find your way around. The same is true for stargazing: The brightest stars and familiar constellations are your landmarks. From there, you can more easily find other, smaller stars. Keep your phone out of it Of course, there are some apps that support your stargazing, but you should keep in mind that stargazing in the open field works better without a smartphone. For one thing, the display is actually much too small to be of any real help. Another reason also makes sense ( ;)): Your eyes don’t manage the change between display and darkness well. Observing the stars is thus made more difficult. So: READ inside. RESEARCH outside. You can get an overview with Star Charts There are many star maps available online that can help you get started. This can be done from your window. You can either follow the current state of the sky at the given hour, or you can do it yourself. Celestial events in 2025 There will be a series of breathtaking astronomical events in 2025. Some of the highlights according to KOSMOS Sky Year are Tip: If you want to help science while stargazing (on vacation or at home), you can participate in the Globe at Night project. For instance, you can report whether you were able to identify all the stars in Pegasus. What is light pollution? Stars are best seen in total darkness. That’s logical, you might think. However, total darkness is not so easy to find in our world, especially in Central Europe. So-called light pollution dominates. Our Earth is getting brighter by 9.6 percent every year. Of the trillions of stars in the universe, only 3,000 can be seen with the naked eye! We use so much light to illuminate our streets and buildings that we can’t see shooting stars or the Milky Way. Do you know about the light that shines over cities and populated areas? While the effects of light pollution on insects have been known for a long time, the impact of artificial light on marine life has only recently begun to be studied. “Darkness is a habitat,” – Mark Lenz, scientific coordinator of the international marine research project The fight against light pollution has inspired the International Dark Sky Association (IDA) to designate the Eifel National Park in North Rhine-Westphalia and tthe Westhavelland Nature Park in Brandenburg as Germany’s first star parks. In these particularly dark places, you can see the Milky Way perfectly at night. Nebulae and even more distant galaxies are also visible when there is little or no light pollution. Special places for stargazing The star parks also offer guided tours. Of course, you can view constellations and the Milky Way from just about anywhere, including from the Green Pearls® accommodations. And we asked them where the best places are to look for stars, how much or how little light pollution there is, and if there are any stargazing tours available. Alone without light pollution The Klosterhof Alpine Hideaway & Spa in Upper Bavaria is located on a plateau in Bayerisch Gmain, which is (almost) alone in its location and where air pollution is significantly reduced. Every Friday, a Late Spa Night “Sole, Moon & Stars” is offered until 10 pm. Relax in the Jacuzzi and let your eyes wander. The highlights are the monthly ‘full moon’ concerts. You may be lucky enough to experience these celebrations outside on the terrace, giving you the opportunity to watch the (full) moon while listening to music. Become a stargazer in the light protection area STURM’s location also provides the perfect environment for avid stargazers. The Rhön has been declared a light protection area. Due to the low light pollution you can discover stars, the Milky Way and even planets. There are designated areas with wooden sofas for stargazing. In addition, there are regular events about the stars, such as the star park weeks in August. Sternpark Rhön e.V. offers public and private guided tours to learn more about the stars throughout the year. The site also offers free star maps to help you identify the stars in the sky. Sleep outside and never miss a shooting star But you can enjoy your new hobby not only on special tours. The Lifestylehotel SAND offers a very special experience. The SAND Sleeping Basket is available year-round and is perfect for a night under the stars. You can fall asleep and wake up with a view of the stars, the hinterland and the Baltic Sea from the hotel’s roof terrace. Viewpoint as an observatory If you’re looking for another perfect place for stargazing, you’ll find it very close to Hotel Luise. You can see a clear starry sky from a hill near Marloffstein, which is near Marloffstein in the district of Erlangen-Höchstadt. You also have a clear view of the sky from the hotel’s roof terrace. But at Hotel Luise, you don’t even have to leave the building, let alone your bed, to see the stars. In some of the double rooms, you can enjoy hand-painted starry skies that glow in the dark =) The sky full of stars The Naturhotel Outside in East Tyrol also presents itself as the perfect place for stargazers. It is idyllically located in the Hohe Tauern National Park. Because pollution is low in the mountains, stargazing is a natural activity under cloudless skies – even from the heated outdoor pool 😉 Night walks in the moonlight Would you like to walk in the moonlight and discover stars and constellations? The location of the Hotel SCHWARZWALD PANORAMA in the spa town of Bad Herrenalb is ideal for stargazing. Since there are no big cities nearby. In Bad Herrenalb, there are also frequent guided tours or night walks on this theme. If you are on vacation with the whole family or with friends, you can book a night watchman tour with night watchman Bernhard Lohner for 85 euros (all-inclusive price for a group of 2 to 25 people). In dark corners he will tell you many things about the night and a forgotten time… Noctourism helps to reduce light pollution As the aforementioned Booking.com study on travel trends for 2025 found, sustainability is important to many travellers. The surprising new trend of noctourism supports this: ‘A majority of travellers (54%) would book accommodation without lighting in order to reduce light pollution and protect flora and fauna.’ – Booking.com survey According to the scientists around Mark Lenz, the switch to LED – which makes light cheaper – has led to more light being used. If you visit dark sky parks and light-protected areas as a tourist, you support these dark habitats. Furthermore, you can also make sure not to unnecessarily brighten up your surroundings with non-stop garden lighting, etc."
The 5 most beautiful eco-luxury hotels in the Alps,"Clean beaches and seas, unspoiled nature in the mountains – that’s what tourists want. And hotels want to deliver. The problem is that the hotel industry itself is a major source of plastic waste. Single-use plastics in the form of typical hotel slippers, small packages in the bathroom and at the buffet, along with straws and cups, add up to mountains of plastic in conventional hotels. We took a look at sustainable Green PearlsⓇ hotels, what alternatives are available and how to avoid single-use plastics in general. The problem with disposables in hotels When you stay at a hotel, you get everything you need: your luggage is taken care of, a refreshing drink is waiting for you in your room, a variety of toiletries are available in the bathroom, towels and slippers are provided… and while you are lying by the pool or sitting in the restaurant, your room is cleaned, the bed is made and all opened tubes and packages are replaced with new ones. Sound great? For sustainability-minded travelers like you, probably not. Because: All of this (among other things) creates a lot of waste. Hotels and vacation rentals definitely have a single-use problem, and it has to do with the following:: Expensive hotels produce less waste than cheap ones According to the DEHOGA environmental brochure, 0 to 2-star hotels produce 9.1 liters of waste per guest per day, 4-star hotels 3.4 liters (5-star hotels produce slightly more at 3.7 liters). According to the German Hotel and Restaurant Association (DEHOGA), this is mainly due to disposable packaging in the lower star categories. In the upscale hotel industry, less disposable packaging is used simply for style’s sake – e.g. cloth napkins instead of paper napkins, ceramic or stainless steel milk jugs instead of plastic condensed milk containers, etc. But simply choosing a higher star rating is not enough to eliminate waste and single-use packaging. Especially since not everyone can or wants to. Above all, it takes hoteliers who really care and are committed to reducing waste in their properties. Zero waste or at least “less waste” is a central concern for Green Pearls® accommodations. Each accommodation has its own approach to waste reduction, which you can read about on the Green Pearls® pages and on their individual websites. As mentioned above, many of them are Zero Waste representatives, striving for a low environmental footprint and a circular economy in all areas. We believe that Green PearlsⓇ hotels are among the lowest waste producers in the industry. “In terms of waste and plastic reduction, sustainably certified hotels are generally more advanced than non-certified hotels.” – WWF WWF study on single-use and reusable products in the hospitality industry In 2019 and 2024, WWF Germany investigated the issue of single-use plastics in the hotel industry. For the 2019 study, WWF surveyed hotels and hotel guests in Italy, France, Greece and Spain. In 2024, the data was supplemented by expert interviews and a literature review. It found that the majority of guests use significantly more reusable packaging at home than on vacation. Hoteliers are determined to act, but face many obstacles: For every 50 million disposables, only half a million reusables are sold “In 2022, the share of reusable packaging (by number of items) in the hotel industry was only 1.2 percent. (600,000 items compared to 50.6 million disposable items) and consisted almost entirely of beverage containers.” – Untersuchung der Gesellschaft für Verpackungsmarktforschung mbH (GVM) für den WWF All too often, “habit” is to blame for not using reusable products. By the way, the WWF believes that reusable products make much more sense than disposable products made from “eco-materials”. In other words, a refillable plastic bottle is better than a disposable bamboo cup. Washable cloth napkins are better than disposable napkins made from recycled cellulose. This is how sustainable hotels avoid disposable packaging Amenities upon request Many sustainable hotels and resorts have started to remove amenities such as toothbrushes, razors, sewing kits, etc. from the rooms and store them at the front desk. That way, you still get them, but only if you really need and ask for them. “By providing standard amenities only upon request, we avoid unnecessary use,” says Farmhouse Smiling Gecko in Cambodia. The resort also offers many homemade products from the resort’s own workshops, which Smiling Gecko uses to support the local community. When it comes to the amenities that are still offered on request, sustainable accommodation also ensures that they are produced sustainably and fairly. This is what the Naturresort Gerbehof in Friedrichshafen on Lake Constance reports. Honesty bar with reusable glasses instead of a minibar The minibar is another element that must be provided to meet hotel standards. In addition to energy consumption, drinks and snacks in disposable packaging also have a negative impact on the environment. Gut Guntrams near Vienna therefore installed a “central minibar” in the form of a Honesty Bar and left the individual minibars in the rooms empty. The Honesty Bar offers homemade sweet and savory treats in reusable glass jars. Homemade welcome cookies A small welcome gift for guests is a nice touch. But as Zero Waste advocate Béá Johnson says, promotional gifts and giveaways are often a source of waste. Not so at the Hotel Bella Vista Zermatt in Switzerland. There, homemade cookies on a plate greet guests in the mountains near the Matterhorn. A water bottle for the duration of your stay Many hotels provide their guests with a refillable water bottle. At the OCÉANO Health Spa Hotel on Tenerife, the “OCÉANO Glass Bottle” is available and there are water dispensers throughout the hotel where you can refill the bottle with fresh, filtered water. This fits in with the wide range of sports and wellness activities on offer and also saves a lot of bottles and miles of transportation 🙂 Source of waste: breakfast buffet? Zero waste is also an option! One of the biggest contributors to packaging and food waste in the hotel industry is the breakfast buffet. All Green Pearls® hotels have optimized this aspect. “There are no packaged products at our breakfast buffet,” reports the APIPURA hotel rinner on the ritten in South Tyrol. Instead, the child-friendly hotel offers organic products in small jars – one of the highlights are the various types of organic honey from the hotel’s own beekeeping. Zero waste measures at the breakfast buffet: Elimination of disposable hygiene products Disposable bathroom hygiene products are the second major area where mountains of plastic waste accumulate in conventional hotels. This refers to the small packages of shampoo, shower gel, soap, body lotion, shower cap, toothbrush, razor and so on. Sustainable hotels show that these products can be provided to guests in a stylish and hygienic way and do not have to be the norm. Solid Soap and Shampoo At the Klosterhof Alpine Hideaway & Spa in Berchtesgadener Land, Bavaria, the bathroom features soap and shampoo bars, as well as refillable shower gel dispensers as an alternative to traditional bottles. You can do the same at home, by the way! Dispenser Speaking of dispensers: Another option you might want to consider for the home are refillable, larger, and often more attractive dispensers for soap, shampoo, conditioner, shower gel, and the like. According to soap manufacturer MarcelsGreenSoap, a refill bag saves 85% of plastic packaging! Almost all Green Pearls® accommodations now use dispensers – with natural ingredients. “Our shampoos and shower gels (in the dispensers) are from Tiroler Kräuterhof, so they are 100% natural and regional,” reports Summit Lodges Pfunds. Biohotel Grafenast in Tyrol even offers dispensers with arnica muscle gel for relaxation after long hikes around the Pillberg 😉 Natural cosmetics free of chemicals and microplastics For our Green PearlsⓇ partners, the use of environmentally friendly cosmetic products is very important. At Pavilions Himalayas – The Farm in Nepal, you can buy bamboo toothbrushes with hemp bristles and plastic-free toothpaste tabs made according to Ayurvedic principles, as are the other personal care products. Avoiding chemicals and microplastics is particularly important to them to protect the water quality of their organic farm.. The Green Spirit hotels in Paris (Hotel Malar, Hotel Amelie and Hotel Le Pavillon, all in the central 7th arrondissement within walking distance of the Eiffel Tower) use soaps, shampoos and shower gels from Austrian natural cosmetics company Pure Green. The luxurious Klosterbräu wellness hotel in Seefeld, Tyrol, spoils its guests with premium products from Augustinus Bader – some of which have been developed exclusively for the hotel. The Lifestylehotel SAND in Timmendorfer Strand on the Baltic Sea has embraced ‘Björk&Berries‘. Nordic, sustainable, refillable and stylish,” they say. Food from their own harvest In the hotel industry, buying food in bulk is one way to reduce unnecessary packaging. Where possible, regionally. “We work almost exclusively with local suppliers to avoid long transport routes and support the regional economy,” says My Arbor near Brixen in South Tyrol. However, food packaging is avoided in particular through direct in-house production. “From cakes to chocolates to syrups, we make everything ourselves,” explains the adults-only wellness hotel. “All our fresh fruit and vegetables come from our own farm in Albisano on Lake Garda. The owner, Mr Huber, personally takes care of the harvest and brings the produce directly to the hotel (without packaging waste) so that our guests can enjoy the freshest ingredients.” – My Arbor Dishes and glasses Disposable plastic cups at hotels? They do exist! Some hoteliers find them more convenient and less risky than glass or porcelain, especially for the lawn or pool. Unfortunately, they create a huge amount of waste. Sustainable hotels are careful to use only high-quality, plastic-free materials. The energy-independent aparthotel OLM Nature Escape in Sand in Taufers, South Tyrol, uses only glass, porcelain, ceramic, clay and enamel for food and drink. Tablecloths and napkins Just as glass and porcelain are more stylish than plastic tableware, cloth napkins are more sophisticated than paper napkins. You can find them, for example, at the Relais del Maro in Liguria. The Albergo Diffuso in the picturesque village of Borgomaro takes care to avoid waste in all areas. Consequently, linen tablecloths are washed rather than thrown away. Towel change upon request only Since laundry does not produce waste, but does use detergent, water and energy, daily hotel laundry is another factor that you, as a guest, can help with. Many guests notice that even towels that have been hung up are all replaced the next day. This calls for well-trained staff who, like at the Lifestyle Resort Zum Kurfürsten on the Mosel, change towels only when requested. Even in the large wellness area with sauna and several pools, guests are asked to use sauna towels sparingly and sometimes several times. Forgoing daily room cleaning and turn-down service Similarly, as a guest, you can support a hotel’s sustainability efforts by choosing not to have your room cleaned daily. In most cases, you have to explicitly decline. For example, the sustainable Hotel Luise in Erlangen, Germany, tried to switch to opt-in (i.e., you get daily room cleaning only if you want it), but that would have meant being stripped of all their hotel stars by the Hotel Stars Union! However, at the ADLER Lodge RITTEN in South Tyrol (a luxurious all-inclusive resort close to nature), the turndown service has become an opt-in offer. This means that rooms are only prepared in the evening if you, the guest, specifically request it. No slippers The slippers provided in a hotel’s spa area are disposable products that generate huge amounts of waste. According to the German magazine Focus, the Steigenberger Hotels alone (a total of 60 hotels and resorts) would order 180,000 pairs of slippers for their guests each year. One can only imagine the mountain of slipper waste in the entire industry! The HUBERTUS Mountain Refugio Allgäu has therefore removed the slippers from the rooms and will only provide them upon request. Instead, guests are asked to bring their own. The romantic Hotel Das Rübezahl in Füssen, Germany, takes a similar approach to the slipper issue: guests are only provided with hotel slippers for the spa upon request, and the slippers are made of linen and cork, making them compostable. Backpack and shopping bag provided In many vacation destinations, plastic bags are still the norm. Even though a lot of plastic waste could be avoided! That is why CERVO Mountain Resort Zermatt in Switzerland provides guests with both a backpack for hiking and reusable bags for shopping. Digital Guest Magazine Digitization also reduces waste. Guests receive a digital reservation confirmation, there is a digital guest magazine and digital services. At the Eco-Hotel Okelmann’s, for example, you can download Komoot maps created by Senior Okelmann to your phone so you can start cycling right away. The Hotel Klosterbräu in Seefeld, Tyrol, has a guest channel on the hotel TV where you can find out about all the events and offers at the hotel. Offering waste separation for guests As mentioned at the beginning, many people use more disposable items on vacation than at home. Recycling is also often not as successful on vacation. However, this is not always the guests’ fault… You may have experienced the situation where there is only one disposable waste bin in the hotel room and you don’t even have the opportunity to separate your own waste. Some hotels may also think that their international guests don’t know how to it. Not so at Keemala on the island of Phuket in Thailand. “We have clearly marked recycling and waste stations throughout the resort, making it easy for guests to dispose of their waste properly,” they wrote to us. Unlike many internationally managed hotels on the island of Phuket, Keemala is owned by a local family who are very conscious of their impact on the environment. The 5-star ADLER Lodge RITTEN is another example of how in-room waste separation can be done in style. Toilet paper made out of Tetra Pak According to Statista, global per capita consumption of toilet paper reach almost 14 kilograms per person in 2023. However, in Germany, the figure is much higher, at 30.6 kilograms per person. A lot of trees have to be cut down to produce all this fresh fiber. The SCHWARZWALD PANORAMA in Bad Herrenalb has switched to toilet paper made from recycled beverage cartons. This reflects the concept of recycling that the wellness and selfness hotel also applies to its room furnishings. Wooden coffee pods eliminate single-use plastics Coffee capsule machines are definitely not the most sustainable way to make coffee. However, they are a great solution for allowing guests in a hotel suite to make their own coffee. The Birkenhof***** Spa and Genuss Resort uses Rezemo wooden coffee capsules. They contain coffee from sustainable sources. The other amenities of the 5-star wellness hotel are packaged in plastic-free cardboard as well. Zero-Waste Goodbye Gift When you leave, hotels often give you a small parting gift – and that too is a source of packaging waste. Of course, sustainable hotels have also thought about how to give you, the guest, a gift that is both beautiful and environmentally friendly. At the Naturhotel Outside in the Hohe Tauern National Park in East Tyrol, Austria, guests receive a jar of homemade jam in a reusable glass jar. The Hotel Weihrerhof in South Tyrol, on the Italian side of the Alps, offers soaps from its own organic cosmetics line, BergSea, which uses water from the Wolfsgruben Lake, located directly in front of the hotel. “We want our guests to take the soaps home with them and continue to dream of the Weihrerhof,” says the host family. As you can see, Green PearlsⓇ hotels have put a lot of thought into how they can eliminate single-use items, waste and plastic, which means you may use no more single-use items on your vacation than you would at home – in fact, you may use fewer items than at home!"
"Hiking in Germany, Austria and Switzerland","Skis on, out of the hotel and onto the slopes – a ski-in, ski-out hotel lets you start your day’s skiing right outside the hotel door, saving you the daily shuttle ride. But that’s not all that makes your ski vacation sustainable. We’ll show you what else to look for and introduce you to six sustainable accommodations right on the slopes. 5 ways to make your ski vacation more sustainable Skiing vacations have been criticized from a sustainability perspective due to the extensive infrastructure required. That’s why we’d like to start by briefly summarizing how you can minimize your carbon footprint on a ski vacation: Ski-in, ski-out hotels with guaranteed snow In the face of climate change, we recommend preparing to compromise and having a “Plan B” in case there is no snow during your booked trip, such as winter hiking or a cultural program. Alternatively, consider staying at ski hotels located in “snow-sure” areas, typically in the Alpine region above 1,200 meters. Is artificial snow an environmental issue? According to Statista, about 90 percent of all ski slopes in Italy have snowmaking systems. In Austria the figure is 70%, in Switzerland 53% and in Germany only 25%. Attitudes toward artificial snow vary widely across the Alpine region. Ski resorts that use artificial snow, such as Dolomiti Superski, argue that artificial snow is “just water”. When forced out of a small hole under high pressure, the cold turns it into snow. This process does not involve any chemicals. Water typically comes from specially constructed reservoirs and returns to the ground as the snow melts. So there are no problems? According to the WWF, there are. Artificial snow requires millions of gallons of water, energy and noise. The absence of trees on the slopes and the compacted ground from grading prevent the snow from being absorbed quickly when it melts, increasing the risk of landslides. The WWF ultimately demands a halt to the development of new ski resorts. It also criticizes hotel complexes as “real energy eaters”. This makes choosing a sustainable ski hotel all the more important. Sustainable ski-in, ski-out hotels in South Tyrol, Tyrol and Switzerland Here are five ski hotels that are right on the slopes and committed to sustainability. As an added bonus, there’s also a vacation home in Tyrol that’s not right on the slopes – but the ski bus stops right outside. #1 Paradiso Pure.Living Vegan Hotel | South Tyrol | Italy The Paradiso Pure.Living Vegan Hotel is located at an altitude of 2,020 meters on the Seiser Alm in the Dolomites. Due to its proximity to the UNESCO World Heritage Site, the hotel feels a special commitment to nature. It is unique in the region in its commitment to the vegan lifestyle. Food and beverages are 100 percent vegan, and as much as possible is organic and locally sourced. For example, you will find many creations with organic South Tyrolean apples, but also vegan pizza for lunch, vegan brownies in the afternoon, dumplings, pasta, herbs and vegetables – a fantastically creative and climate-friendly plant-based cuisine that you should try, even if you are not vegan! In addition to its magnificent location on two ski slopes, the hotel offers a spa area with several saunas and an outdoor saltwater hot tub. The hotel also promotes contemporary art with rotating exhibitions. Furthermore, it uses green electricity from Alperia, which is 90 percent hydroelectric. Ski Resort: The Paradiso Pure.Living Vegan Hotel is located in the Seiser Alm ski resort with 32 ski runs. However, the Seiser Alm is only one of twelve interconnected ski resorts, all of which are part of the Dolomiti Superski area. This means that with one ski pass you have 1,200 kilometers of slopes at your disposal! (For comparison, 200 kilometers or more of slopes is what you call a “big ski area”). Fortunately, Dolomiti Superski is also committed to sustainability, as detailed here on their website. However, the resort does use artificial snow. According to them, natural snow would not last the entire season, so they have to use artificial one. Sustainable travel: You can reach the Seiser Alm by train. From there the hotel will pick you up with a snow shuttle at a meeting point. #2 Hotel Bella Vista Zermatt | Switzerland Hotel Bella Vista Zermatt is a small, family-run hotel with only 21 rooms. The hotel has a view of the Matterhorn and is located above the center of Zermatt on 1620m. The Anthamatten family has managed the establishment for three generations. Hostess Fabienne Anthamatten is dedicated to zero-waste practices and has a keen interest in old wood and glacier melt. Her husband, Simon, is a mountain guide and helicopter pilot. Fabienne’s sister, Stefanie, a trained yoga teacher, also welcomes guests at the reception. Meanwhile, “Mama” Bernadette delights visitors with her homemade soups and jams. The Swiss hotel is not only family friendly, but also very cozy – with a stone pine parlor and fireplace in the lobby, as well as a small spa area with saunas. Ski area: The hotel is located below the Sunnegga – Rothorn valley station – so the valley run takes you directly to your hotel. Here you are connected to the Rothorn, Gornergrat Glacier and the Matterhorn Paradise ski area, which also includes Zermatt. Matterhorn Paradise is the highest ski area in the Alps (almost 4,000 meters in some places) and the largest summer ski area in Europe. It is open year round as many of the slopes are on glaciers. There are 360 km of slopes and you can even ski to Italy. Zermatt’s cable cars have been investing in sustainability for several years and are TourCert certified. Despite its glacier location, the slopes are regularly covered with artificial snow. Sustainable travel: Zermatt is car-free and accessible by train – as an added bonus, the hotel will even upgrade you to 1st class on the Visp-Zermatt route (for stays of 3 nights or more). Your luggage can be transported separately. A complimentary Hotel Bella Vista shuttle will pick you up at the train station. #3 CERVO Mountain Resort Zermatt | Switzerland The CERVO Mountain Resort, also located in the Swiss ski resort of Zermatt on the Matterhorn, is an exceptional ski-in, ski-out hotel. The sustainable resort consists of several buildings, restaurants and a spa area, and CERVO’s terraces are a popular spot for après-ski. The program includes numerous social events with live music, a group moonlight ski decent, movie night with fondue, etc. So this is the perfect place for you if you want to meet new people and enjoy some entertainment during your ski vacation. Ski area: The resort in Zermatt is also part of the aforementioned Matterhorn Paradise. Sustainable travel: You can also reach CERVO Mountain Resort by train via Zermatt station. Your ski pass can be ordered prior to your arrival and picked up at the reception desk. #4 Biohotel Grafenast | Tirol | Österreich If you are looking for a ski-in-ski-out hotel for a family ski vacation, we recommend the Biohotel Grafenast in Tyrol. The hotel is run by the Unterlechner family. Grandfather “Rodel-Toni” built a toboggan hut on the Pillberg in 1907, which still exists today. Situated at an altitude of 1,330 meters, you have a wonderful view of the valley. With only 23 rooms (some of which are family rooms with separate children’s rooms), the atmosphere is intimate. Organic food, environmental protection and nature are very important to the Unterlechners, which is why they cook only with organic products. Ski area: Biohotel Grafenast is located just 150 meters from the Kellerjoch ski area. The base station of the Kellerjochbahn, which takes you up to 1,890 meters, is just a few steps away. The small ski area has 20 km of slopes and 7 downhill runs, making it perfect for a (first) ski vacation with children. According to Snowtrex, about 30 percent of the slopes are covered with artificial snow. By the way, Café Rodel-Toni is located right next to the children’s ski school. Here parents can take a break while the kids learn to ski or play in the Kinderland. Sustainable travel: The closest train stations are Jenbach and Schwaz. For stays of three nights or more, half the taxi fare to the Biohotel will be reimbursed. #5 My Arbor | Südtirol | Italien If you are traveling without children and prefer the tranquility of an adults-only hotel, My Arbor may be just what you are looking for. Located near Brixen, it is an architectural highlight built on stilts in the middle of a spruce forest. The wellness hotel is located directly on the Plose Mountain. „After breakfast, I go to the ski room, put on my ski boots, grab my skis, and head straight from My Arbor to the Plose base station.“ – Alexandra Huber, My Arbor Ski area: The Plose ski area is particularly sunny and with 7 lifts and about 40 km of slopes ranging in altitude from 1,067 to 2,446 meters, quite modest. Its highlight is South Tyrol’s longest downhill run: 9 km. Sustainable travel: Brixen train station has direct connections from many major cities in Italy, Germany and Austria. Guests staying at My Arbor for 7 nights or more are picked up at the station free of charge. Otherwise, a taxi will cost approximately 30 euros for a 15-minute ride. #6 Summit Lodges Pfunds | Tyrol | Austria Finally, we would like to introduce you to two vacation homes that are not ski-in-ski-out, but have a ski bus stop right outside the door. The Summit Lodges Pfunds are American log cabin-style vacation homes that sleep up to six people and have their own sauna and wood-burning fireplace. With their own kitchens, you will be able to cook for yourself and plan your winter vacation at your own pace. Ski area: There are six ski resorts in the area and the ski bus stops just steps away from the apartments. A 20 minute drive will take you to the Tyrolean ski resort Nauders, which has 75 kilometers of slopes between 1,400 and 2,750 meters. The resort is snow sure, but artificial snow is still in use. If you take the ski bus a little further, you can also reach the Italian region of South Tyrol in about 35 minutes. Here at the Reschen Pass, there are 65 kilometers of slopes and 15 ski lifts around the Reschen Lake. Due to the altitude of 1,500 to 2,400 meters, it is considered snow-sure as well, but snow machines are still employed. Artificial snowmaking will continue to spread As you can see, even resorts that advertise sustainability cannot avoid the use of artificial snow. Particularly alarming is the fact that in the United States, slopes are already snowed with the addition of bacteria, a practice banned in Germany and Austria. The bacteria ensure that snow is produced even at low temperatures. Environmentalists fear that this could have unprecedented effects on the environment. But with global warming, it could be an attractive option for more ski resorts. In the future, a ski-in, ski-out vacation will only be possible through sustainability Skiing is far less sustainable than more gentle winter sports such as snowshoeing. All the more reason to consider some sustainability issues when going on a ski vacation. Ski-in-ski-out hotels are located in the heart of the resort, so you can experience nature – and its preparation – firsthand. As wonderful as this is, it should also be possible for future generations."

"Hiking in Germany, Austria and Switzerland","Glittering snow, the sight of snow-capped mountains, and the anticipation of the next run… Do these images come to mind when you think of a winter vacation? Then you feel the same way we do. But that means you probably also face the same challenge we do: Can you enjoy a ski vacation with a clear conscience in the face of the climate and energy crisis? And what do sustainable skiing holidays even look like? Winter Tourism and its Environmental Impact Every year, millions of winter sports enthusiasts travel to ski resorts around the world. In Europe, the Alps are the destination of choice. Of course, the same is true for hikers and bikers in spring, summer, and fall. However, skiing in particular is not without environmental consequences. At peak times, such as New Year’s Eve and the winter holidays, too many people descend on the valleys, the preparation of the slopes has a massive impact on the natural ecosystem, and off-piste skiing and night skiing disturb wildlife. Then there are the effects of man-made climate change. Warmer winters with less snow are causing problems, especially for low-lying resorts. Artificial Snow for Profit Snow cannons are often used to maintain the economic viability of ski resorts that depend on winter tourism. However, they have a serious impact on the environment. For one, they require a lot of water to produce artificial snow (which is often lacking in the surrounding natural environment): more than 4,700,000 liters per hectare can easily accumulate in a single season. In addition, artificial snow systems consume a lot of energy – the equivalent of 130,000 four-person households per year. On top of that, artificial snow has a different chemical composition than natural snow. It is less permeable to air, more compact, and less thermally insulating, which puts a strain on the soil and vegetation. The additional meltwater in spring is another problem. Sustainability and Skiing: Can they go Hand in Hand? After our brief summary, which really only shows a tiny part of the environmental impact of ski tourism, you may be wondering if a ski vacation can be sustainable at all. The short answer is no. You (we!) cannot have a fully sustainable ski vacation. Or any kind of travel for that matter. But what we can do is minimize the negative impacts and increase the positive ones. Because not everything about ski tourism is bad. Many regions are dependent on (ski) tourism. And even though most tourist regions in the Alps and in the mountains, in general, are trying harder to make the other seasons attractive for vacationers, winter tourism remains an important pillar on which livelihoods are built. We will now show you what eco-conscious skiing could look like, what you need to consider when planning and preparing your vacation, and which Green Pearls® partners offer the right accommodations. 7 Tips for a More Sustainable Ski Vacation 1. Avoid mass tourism and travel during low season. If you are not tied to school vacations, you can book your ski vacation off-season. Not only will you save a few dollars, but you will not be sharing the snowy mountains with as many people as you would during peak season. That’s not only better for your nerves, it’s also better for the environment. When many people crowd into (remote) resorts, it puts a lot of pressure on those areas. This is known as “overtourism“, which has particularly serious consequences for the fragile ecosystems of the Alps. 2. Make your journey eco-friendly. Getting to your winter vacation is easy by train. Many Green Pearls® partners have good public transport connections. If you’re driving, for example, because you don’t want to lug your equipment through the train, choose ski resorts that are close to you or as close as possible. For instance, Balderschwang in the Allgäu is among the most snow-sure regions in Germany, with up to twelve meters of snow per season. 3. Buy and maintain your ski equipment sustainably. You can and should consider sustainability when purchasing your equipment. If you only ski once a season or are not sure if you want to continue the hobby, simply rent the equipment locally. Or, if you prefer, at a sporting goods store near where you live. If you want to own your own equipment, check out the ski sales in your area. They usually take place in late fall and you can buy well-maintained, often one-season equipment for a fraction of the original price. If you ski a lot and want to buy new equipment, choose sustainable companies. Examples include Atomic, Vaude, and Stöckli. If you then have your skis and board waxed with environmentally friendly, petroleum-free wax, you can make another small contribution to protecting the environment. 4. Local transportation Once you arrive at your resort, you can usually just leave your car for the rest of your stay. Many resorts have ski buses that leave your accommodation and take you to the valley stations of the resorts. Or perhaps the first slopes and trails start right outside the hotel, as is the case at the Paradiso Pure.Living Vegan Hotel on the Seiser Alm, the HUBERTUS Mountain Refugio in Balderschwang in the Allgäu region, or at the Hotel Bella Vista in Zermatt, Switzerland. It’s best to check the local and logistical conditions in advance. 5. Protect plants and animals For some skiers, there is nothing more exciting than skiing on fresh snow. But it is not great for nature. To avoid endangering wildlife and protect plants, it is important to stay on groomed slopes, trails, and paths. In the long run, all winter sports enthusiasts will benefit more if these marked boundaries are respected. This also applies to hiking and other activities in the mountains. Winter or summer. 6. Book a sustainable accommodation If you want to be sure that your accommodation is doing all it can to make your vacation as sustainable and environmentally friendly as possible, then book with one of our Green Pearls® partners. They do their best every day to conserve resources, strengthen the region, and keep their environmental footprint as small as possible. This way you can enjoy your winter vacation without a guilty conscience. In addition to the hotels mentioned above, we highly recommend The Peak in Sölden and Summit Lodges Pfunds in the Tyrolean Oberland. At both, you can take off your slippers, put on your ski boots, and hit the slopes. 7. Choose sustainable ski destinations When choosing a ski resort, try to find one that uses little or no artificial snow. The use of renewable energy and monitoring visitor numbers to prevent overcrowding on the mountain are also part of a sustainable resort. In South Tyrol, for example, almost all resorts have invested in renewable energy generation from the sun and water to power the facilities. Ski trails are designed to minimize the impact on nature, and free ski buses connect towns and resorts. The climate-friendly resort of Carezza has even pledged to become carbon neutral by 2025. It already has intelligent control of its snow cannons, and the water it uses to make artificial snow comes from its own reservoirs, not the environment. If you are unsure about how the resort of your choice is addressing these issues, you can always check in advance with the local tourist office or lift operators. In the Alps, for example, 19 destinations have joined forces under the banner of “Alpine Pearls” to promote environmentally friendly tourism.  The destinations under the umbrella of this association focus on soft mobility in their diverse mobility offers. As a guest, you can travel through the region in an environmentally friendly way thanks to innovative and climate-friendly travel offers. The avoidance of artificially groomed slopes, the use of renewable energies, and the monitoring of visitor numbers in the mountains are further important and conscious measures taken by Alpine Pearls towards sustainable ski tourism. A more Sustainable Ski Vacation? It can be done! Even if we can never have a 100% sustainable ski vacation, we hope these tips have shown you that we can at least travel more sustainably. And it doesn’t take much effort, does it? As a winter sports enthusiast, how do you sustainably practice your beloved snow hobby? Do you take responsibility for the climate and our planet?

The 5 most beautiful eco-luxury hotels in the Alps,"Clean beaches and seas, unspoiled nature in the mountains – that’s what tourists want. And hotels want to deliver. The problem is that the hotel industry itself is a major source of plastic waste. Single-use plastics in the form of typical hotel slippers, small packages in the bathroom and at the buffet, along with straws and cups, add up to mountains of plastic in conventional hotels. We took a look at sustainable Green PearlsⓇ hotels, what alternatives are available and how to avoid single-use plastics in general. The problem with disposables in hotels When you stay at a hotel, you get everything you need: your luggage is taken care of, a refreshing drink is waiting for you in your room, a variety of toiletries are available in the bathroom, towels and slippers are provided… and while you are lying by the pool or sitting in the restaurant, your room is cleaned, the bed is made and all opened tubes and packages are replaced with new ones. Sound great? For sustainability-minded travelers like you, probably not. Because: All of this (among other things) creates a lot of waste. Hotels and vacation rentals definitely have a single-use problem, and it has to do with the following:: Expensive hotels produce less waste than cheap ones According to the DEHOGA environmental brochure, 0 to 2-star hotels produce 9.1 liters of waste per guest per day, 4-star hotels 3.4 liters (5-star hotels produce slightly more at 3.7 liters). According to the German Hotel and Restaurant Association (DEHOGA), this is mainly due to disposable packaging in the lower star categories. In the upscale hotel industry, less disposable packaging is used simply for style’s sake – e.g. cloth napkins instead of paper napkins, ceramic or stainless steel milk jugs instead of plastic condensed milk containers, etc. But simply choosing a higher star rating is not enough to eliminate waste and single-use packaging. Especially since not everyone can or wants to. Above all, it takes hoteliers who really care and are committed to reducing waste in their properties. Zero waste or at least “less waste” is a central concern for Green Pearls® accommodations. Each accommodation has its own approach to waste reduction, which you can read about on the Green Pearls® pages and on their individual websites. As mentioned above, many of them are Zero Waste representatives, striving for a low environmental footprint and a circular economy in all areas. We believe that Green PearlsⓇ hotels are among the lowest waste producers in the industry. “In terms of waste and plastic reduction, sustainably certified hotels are generally more advanced than non-certified hotels.” – WWF WWF study on single-use and reusable products in the hospitality industry In 2019 and 2024, WWF Germany investigated the issue of single-use plastics in the hotel industry. For the 2019 study, WWF surveyed hotels and hotel guests in Italy, France, Greece and Spain. In 2024, the data was supplemented by expert interviews and a literature review. It found that the majority of guests use significantly more reusable packaging at home than on vacation. Hoteliers are determined to act, but face many obstacles: For every 50 million disposables, only half a million reusables are sold “In 2022, the share of reusable packaging (by number of items) in the hotel industry was only 1.2 percent. (600,000 items compared to 50.6 million disposable items) and consisted almost entirely of beverage containers.” – Untersuchung der Gesellschaft für Verpackungsmarktforschung mbH (GVM) für den WWF All too often, “habit” is to blame for not using reusable products. By the way, the WWF believes that reusable products make much more sense than disposable products made from “eco-materials”. In other words, a refillable plastic bottle is better than a disposable bamboo cup. Washable cloth napkins are better than disposable napkins made from recycled cellulose. This is how sustainable hotels avoid disposable packaging Amenities upon request Many sustainable hotels and resorts have started to remove amenities such as toothbrushes, razors, sewing kits, etc. from the rooms and store them at the front desk. That way, you still get them, but only if you really need and ask for them. “By providing standard amenities only upon request, we avoid unnecessary use,” says Farmhouse Smiling Gecko in Cambodia. The resort also offers many homemade products from the resort’s own workshops, which Smiling Gecko uses to support the local community. When it comes to the amenities that are still offered on request, sustainable accommodation also ensures that they are produced sustainably and fairly. This is what the Naturresort Gerbehof in Friedrichshafen on Lake Constance reports. Honesty bar with reusable glasses instead of a minibar The minibar is another element that must be provided to meet hotel standards. In addition to energy consumption, drinks and snacks in disposable packaging also have a negative impact on the environment. Gut Guntrams near Vienna therefore installed a “central minibar” in the form of a Honesty Bar and left the individual minibars in the rooms empty. The Honesty Bar offers homemade sweet and savory treats in reusable glass jars. Homemade welcome cookies A small welcome gift for guests is a nice touch. But as Zero Waste advocate Béá Johnson says, promotional gifts and giveaways are often a source of waste. Not so at the Hotel Bella Vista Zermatt in Switzerland. There, homemade cookies on a plate greet guests in the mountains near the Matterhorn. A water bottle for the duration of your stay Many hotels provide their guests with a refillable water bottle. At the OCÉANO Health Spa Hotel on Tenerife, the “OCÉANO Glass Bottle” is available and there are water dispensers throughout the hotel where you can refill the bottle with fresh, filtered water. This fits in with the wide range of sports and wellness activities on offer and also saves a lot of bottles and miles of transportation 🙂 Source of waste: breakfast buffet? Zero waste is also an option! One of the biggest contributors to packaging and food waste in the hotel industry is the breakfast buffet. All Green Pearls® hotels have optimized this aspect. “There are no packaged products at our breakfast buffet,” reports the APIPURA hotel rinner on the ritten in South Tyrol. Instead, the child-friendly hotel offers organic products in small jars – one of the highlights are the various types of organic honey from the hotel’s own beekeeping. Zero waste measures at the breakfast buffet: Elimination of disposable hygiene products Disposable bathroom hygiene products are the second major area where mountains of plastic waste accumulate in conventional hotels. This refers to the small packages of shampoo, shower gel, soap, body lotion, shower cap, toothbrush, razor and so on. Sustainable hotels show that these products can be provided to guests in a stylish and hygienic way and do not have to be the norm. Solid Soap and Shampoo At the Klosterhof Alpine Hideaway & Spa in Berchtesgadener Land, Bavaria, the bathroom features soap and shampoo bars, as well as refillable shower gel dispensers as an alternative to traditional bottles. You can do the same at home, by the way! Dispenser Speaking of dispensers: Another option you might want to consider for the home are refillable, larger, and often more attractive dispensers for soap, shampoo, conditioner, shower gel, and the like. According to soap manufacturer MarcelsGreenSoap, a refill bag saves 85% of plastic packaging! Almost all Green Pearls® accommodations now use dispensers – with natural ingredients. “Our shampoos and shower gels (in the dispensers) are from Tiroler Kräuterhof, so they are 100% natural and regional,” reports Summit Lodges Pfunds. Biohotel Grafenast in Tyrol even offers dispensers with arnica muscle gel for relaxation after long hikes around the Pillberg 😉 Natural cosmetics free of chemicals and microplastics For our Green PearlsⓇ partners, the use of environmentally friendly cosmetic products is very important. At Pavilions Himalayas – The Farm in Nepal, you can buy bamboo toothbrushes with hemp bristles and plastic-free toothpaste tabs made according to Ayurvedic principles, as are the other personal care products. Avoiding chemicals and microplastics is particularly important to them to protect the water quality of their organic farm.. The Green Spirit hotels in Paris (Hotel Malar, Hotel Amelie and Hotel Le Pavillon, all in the central 7th arrondissement within walking distance of the Eiffel Tower) use soaps, shampoos and shower gels from Austrian natural cosmetics company Pure Green. The luxurious Klosterbräu wellness hotel in Seefeld, Tyrol, spoils its guests with premium products from Augustinus Bader – some of which have been developed exclusively for the hotel. The Lifestylehotel SAND in Timmendorfer Strand on the Baltic Sea has embraced ‘Björk&Berries‘. Nordic, sustainable, refillable and stylish,” they say. Food from their own harvest In the hotel industry, buying food in bulk is one way to reduce unnecessary packaging. Where possible, regionally. “We work almost exclusively with local suppliers to avoid long transport routes and support the regional economy,” says My Arbor near Brixen in South Tyrol. However, food packaging is avoided in particular through direct in-house production. “From cakes to chocolates to syrups, we make everything ourselves,” explains the adults-only wellness hotel. “All our fresh fruit and vegetables come from our own farm in Albisano on Lake Garda. The owner, Mr Huber, personally takes care of the harvest and brings the produce directly to the hotel (without packaging waste) so that our guests can enjoy the freshest ingredients.” – My Arbor Dishes and glasses Disposable plastic cups at hotels? They do exist! Some hoteliers find them more convenient and less risky than glass or porcelain, especially for the lawn or pool. Unfortunately, they create a huge amount of waste. Sustainable hotels are careful to use only high-quality, plastic-free materials. The energy-independent aparthotel OLM Nature Escape in Sand in Taufers, South Tyrol, uses only glass, porcelain, ceramic, clay and enamel for food and drink. Tablecloths and napkins Just as glass and porcelain are more stylish than plastic tableware, cloth napkins are more sophisticated than paper napkins. You can find them, for example, at the Relais del Maro in Liguria. The Albergo Diffuso in the picturesque village of Borgomaro takes care to avoid waste in all areas. Consequently, linen tablecloths are washed rather than thrown away. Towel change upon request only Since laundry does not produce waste, but does use detergent, water and energy, daily hotel laundry is another factor that you, as a guest, can help with. Many guests notice that even towels that have been hung up are all replaced the next day. This calls for well-trained staff who, like at the Lifestyle Resort Zum Kurfürsten on the Mosel, change towels only when requested. Even in the large wellness area with sauna and several pools, guests are asked to use sauna towels sparingly and sometimes several times. Forgoing daily room cleaning and turn-down service Similarly, as a guest, you can support a hotel’s sustainability efforts by choosing not to have your room cleaned daily. In most cases, you have to explicitly decline. For example, the sustainable Hotel Luise in Erlangen, Germany, tried to switch to opt-in (i.e., you get daily room cleaning only if you want it), but that would have meant being stripped of all their hotel stars by the Hotel Stars Union! However, at the ADLER Lodge RITTEN in South Tyrol (a luxurious all-inclusive resort close to nature), the turndown service has become an opt-in offer. This means that rooms are only prepared in the evening if you, the guest, specifically request it. No slippers The slippers provided in a hotel’s spa area are disposable products that generate huge amounts of waste. According to the German magazine Focus, the Steigenberger Hotels alone (a total of 60 hotels and resorts) would order 180,000 pairs of slippers for their guests each year. One can only imagine the mountain of slipper waste in the entire industry! The HUBERTUS Mountain Refugio Allgäu has therefore removed the slippers from the rooms and will only provide them upon request. Instead, guests are asked to bring their own. The romantic Hotel Das Rübezahl in Füssen, Germany, takes a similar approach to the slipper issue: guests are only provided with hotel slippers for the spa upon request, and the slippers are made of linen and cork, making them compostable. Backpack and shopping bag provided In many vacation destinations, plastic bags are still the norm. Even though a lot of plastic waste could be avoided! That is why CERVO Mountain Resort Zermatt in Switzerland provides guests with both a backpack for hiking and reusable bags for shopping. Digital Guest Magazine Digitization also reduces waste. Guests receive a digital reservation confirmation, there is a digital guest magazine and digital services. At the Eco-Hotel Okelmann’s, for example, you can download Komoot maps created by Senior Okelmann to your phone so you can start cycling right away. The Hotel Klosterbräu in Seefeld, Tyrol, has a guest channel on the hotel TV where you can find out about all the events and offers at the hotel. Offering waste separation for guests As mentioned at the beginning, many people use more disposable items on vacation than at home. Recycling is also often not as successful on vacation. However, this is not always the guests’ fault… You may have experienced the situation where there is only one disposable waste bin in the hotel room and you don’t even have the opportunity to separate your own waste. Some hotels may also think that their international guests don’t know how to it. Not so at Keemala on the island of Phuket in Thailand. “We have clearly marked recycling and waste stations throughout the resort, making it easy for guests to dispose of their waste properly,” they wrote to us. Unlike many internationally managed hotels on the island of Phuket, Keemala is owned by a local family who are very conscious of their impact on the environment. The 5-star ADLER Lodge RITTEN is another example of how in-room waste separation can be done in style. Toilet paper made out of Tetra Pak According to Statista, global per capita consumption of toilet paper reach almost 14 kilograms per person in 2023. However, in Germany, the figure is much higher, at 30.6 kilograms per person. A lot of trees have to be cut down to produce all this fresh fiber. The SCHWARZWALD PANORAMA in Bad Herrenalb has switched to toilet paper made from recycled beverage cartons. This reflects the concept of recycling that the wellness and selfness hotel also applies to its room furnishings. Wooden coffee pods eliminate single-use plastics Coffee capsule machines are definitely not the most sustainable way to make coffee. However, they are a great solution for allowing guests in a hotel suite to make their own coffee. The Birkenhof***** Spa and Genuss Resort uses Rezemo wooden coffee capsules. They contain coffee from sustainable sources. The other amenities of the 5-star wellness hotel are packaged in plastic-free cardboard as well. Zero-Waste Goodbye Gift When you leave, hotels often give you a small parting gift – and that too is a source of packaging waste. Of course, sustainable hotels have also thought about how to give you, the guest, a gift that is both beautiful and environmentally friendly. At the Naturhotel Outside in the Hohe Tauern National Park in East Tyrol, Austria, guests receive a jar of homemade jam in a reusable glass jar. The Hotel Weihrerhof in South Tyrol, on the Italian side of the Alps, offers soaps from its own organic cosmetics line, BergSea, which uses water from the Wolfsgruben Lake, located directly in front of the hotel. “We want our guests to take the soaps home with them and continue to dream of the Weihrerhof,” says the host family. As you can see, Green PearlsⓇ hotels have put a lot of thought into how they can eliminate single-use items, waste and plastic, which means you may use no more single-use items on your vacation than you would at home – in fact, you may use fewer items than at home!"
In the Gardens of our Green Pearls Partners,"Lying by the pool, sipping a chilled lemonade, taking in the view, perhaps even joining a guided tour to explore the stunning natural surroundings and ancient temples – doing good can be so rewarding. All it takes is a charity hotel. What are charity hotels? The term “charity hotel” was coined by Trivago, a hotel search engine, to describe hotels that are actively involved in social causes and donate a portion of their resources or income to charitable causes. Charity hotels are either part of or have a partnership with a non-profit organization. The benefit to you is that you can have a direct positive impact on the local community at your destination without spending extra money or volunteering. Here are three hotels that have made a commitment to a good cause. #1 Farmhouse Smiling Gecko – Luxury Resort and Work & Education Campus in Cambodia The Farmhouse Smiling Gecko in Cambodia is part of the Smiling Gecko Association based in Switzerland. In 2014, the organization founded the “Smiling Gecko Campus” there. With an initial nine hectares, about 60 kilometers from the capital Phnom Penh. The campus has since grown to 150 hectares and is home to a school, kindergarten, handicraft businesses and training centers, as well as agriculture and livestock. A central component is the Farmhouse Smiling Gecko Resort. There are a total of 34 rooms in luxurious houses and bungalows, a swimming pool with pool bar and sundeck. And the hotel restaurant, the gourmet restaurant UN, where chef Mariya Un Noun has made Cambodian fine dining famous far beyond the borders. (You can read more about the restaurant in our blog article about hotel restaurants). Smiling Gecko is all about education and jobs. The jobs are fairly paid and the workshops – such as carpentry, sewing and butchery – are run according to modern Swiss standards. The furniture for the accommodation is made by the carpentry workshop. While the food in the restaurant comes from their own agriculture, cattle breeding and fish farming. A way out of poverty Many of the people who have found work here originally came from the slums of Phnom Penh. As described by the Taramana organization, Cambodia is one of the poorest countries in Southeast Asia. And life in the slums is characterized by overcrowding, unemployment, inadequate sanitation, poor educational opportunities, and poverty. The Smiling Gecko Campus is able to accommodate many people with their whole family. While the parents work on the farm, the children go to kindergarten, school or start an apprenticeship in one of the workshops or at the resort. To ensure that there is enough work for everyone, tourists are encouraged to visit the resort. Here you can enjoy a relaxing and sustainable vacation and use the Green PearlsⓇ Resort as your base to explore Cambodia. Top attractions include temple complexes such as the famous Angkor Wat, floating villages, river markets and pepper plantations. If you are interested in the campus, there are also tours that will give you a better understanding of the entire project. And when you return home, you may find yourself continuing to be a supporter and voice for the project. #2 The Pavillons Himalaya – The Farm – Support for children and organic farming in Nepal According to USAID, Nepal is one of the poorest countries in the world. Poverty particularly affects young girls and women. And tragically, illegal human trafficking is widespread, with many being trafficked to India and beyond. The Pavilions Himalayas – The Farm raises awareness and supports the organization Right4Children by donating 70 percent of its net profits to the empowerment of children. Right4Children supports children and youth Since 1995, Right4Children has operated day centers that provide free childcare and hot meals. There are programs for all ages up to adolescence. As The Pavilions Himalayas reports, funding the Right4Children center in Pokhara (on the same site as the resort) was a motivation from the beginning to build the sustainable tourist accommodation. There are 15 spacious, luxurious Nepalese style villas with stunning views of the countryside and a swimming pool. Sightseeing tours and safaris are available, as well as in-house yoga and meditation. (Learn more about the yoga offerings in our article on sustainable yoga retreats for pros.) Das zweite Standbein ist die ökologische Landwirtschaft, welche das Resort umgibt. Auch hier ist The Pavilions von Anfang an engagiert und baut selbst Bio-Produkte für die Küche an. Zudem motiviert die Nachfrage nach Bio-Produkten, die das Hotel generiert, den Umbau konventioneller Landwirtschaften zu Biobetrieben in der Region. Weitere nachhaltige Maßnahmen sind die Verwendung von Solarenergie, Grauwasser, Erzeugung von Biogas und die Herstellung biologisch abbaubarer Pflegeartikel aus natürlichen Zutaten der Region. #3 Green City Hotel Vauban – Ecologically oriented integration company in Germany Although not a charity hotel in the strict sense, the Green City Hotel Vauban was founded as a hotel with a focus on inclusion and social responsibility from the outset. Located in Freiburg, in the south of Germany, the shareholders of the hotel are the association Freiburger Sozialarbeit e.V. and the municipal housing company Freiburger Stadtbau GmbH. 50 percent of its trainees and employees are people with disabilities who have found a fair and sustainable place to work. The hotel also works with other integrative organizations among its suppliers. For example, its coffee is sourced from a roastery that operates as an integrative organization, and the hotel works with Hofgut Himmelreich for the education and training of its employees. The modern city hotel is largely barrier-free and built in an environmentally friendly way. You will stay in rooms with a bright and friendly architecture and you will be directly connected to the light rail, which will take you to the city center in just 10 minutes. A free regional ticket is available for your stay. 👉 See what you can experience on a sustainable weekend in Freiburg, Germany, here. A stay at Green PearlsⓇ charity hotels offers you not only relaxation and experiences. But also the opportunity to actively contribute to the well-being of others."
Green Wedding: special places for a special day,"Sound massage with Tibetan singing bowls is a wellness trend that is becoming increasingly popular in sustainable hotels that cater to mindful guests. You can find it in Green PearlsⓇ hotels around the world, including Nepal, Cambodia, Thailand, Italy, and Germany. Some offer it as part of their weekly program, others offer it as a spa treatment, and some even organize entire sound massage retreats. Here you can find out where you can add a sound massage to your next trip – and the benefits it can bring you. Peace and relaxation through singing bowls “The massages bring about a state of absolute relaxation that is unique. Even highly stressed people find peace within a short time.” That is how Maren Geisler-Okelmann of the Yoga-Hotel Okelmann’s in Warpe describes the effect of the singing bowls. The hostess is a trained yoga teacher and conducts sound therapy according to Peter HessⓇ in her courses and retreats. The Peter HessⓇ Institute is only 7 km from Warpe! Singing bowl massage according to Peter HessⓇ The singing bowl massage, which is a wellness trend in many places today, was developed by Peter Hess about 30 years ago. The German engineer for physical technology came into contact with singing bowls during his travels in Nepal. According to the institute’s website, he “succeeded in adapting ancient Far Eastern knowledge from the Himalayas about sound and rhythm and their healing effects on body, mind, and soul to the needs of people in Western societies.” It is not entirely clear how singing bowls were originally used. Some researchers even suggest that they were simply used as cooking utensils and that the tradition was “invented” later on. Others suggest that singing bowls once played an important role in Buddhism – but that the tradition has been lost. The Peter HessⓇ Institute (PHI) now has 16 academies in 14 countries and claims to have trained approximately 10,000 people in the Peter Hess Sound Massage Method (protected in Europe). How does a singing bowl massage work? During a Peter HessⓇ singing bowl massage, several singing bowls are placed on the (clothed) body and sounded. The bowls, which are cast in brass or bronze, produce a gong-like sound with fine vibrations. These vibrations are transmitted to the body and are said to “release blockages” and lead to relaxation. Both physical (muscle relaxation) and mental. A singing bowl massage usually lasts between 30 and 90 minutes. “Circling thoughts come to rest,” reports Maren vom Okelmann’s. One enters a “pleasant state in which one can let go.” The vibrations emanating from the singing bowls spread through the skin, tissues, bones, organs, and fluids of the body, creating a “gentle, internal massage.” “Experiencing sound is a wonderful and healing thing.” – Maren Geisler-Okelmann 👉Here you can book a sound massage at Okelmann’s. Difference between singing bowl massage and a sound bath In some wellness and yoga hotels, you can have a sound bath in addition to a singing bowl massage. The difference is: For a singing bowl massage, the bowls are placed on the body, while for a sound bath, the bowls are placed in the room. A sound bath is especially suitable for groups. The vibrations of the gong are transferred from the bowl to the body. At the Biohotel Grafenast in Tyrol, a sound bath in small groups is part of the weekly program, and you can also book a “singing bowl massage with Sabine” at any time. 60 minutes cost 85 Euro and 90 minutes 120 Euro. At Biohotel Grafenast you can experience a great combination of a Tyrolean nature vacation with an Alpine panorama and Far Eastern relaxation methods. The family-run hotel and its surroundings have been designed according to Feng Shui as a place of power, and yoga and Qigong classes are also available. As part of its in-house treatments, the HUBERTUS Mountain Refugio Allgäu offers both a sound bath and a sound massage. The cost for a 50-minute sound bath is 120 euros alone and 180 euros with another person. The sustainable hotel in Balderschwang practices an “Ayurvedic lifestyle” – both in the wellness area and in the culinary arts. The sounds and vibrations of the singing bowls are considered to be energy that “can set every single cell in the body vibrating.” This is believed to have a healing effect. 👉For more information, visit HUBERTUS Ayurveda. Sound baths in the Italian ADLER Spa Resorts & Lodges weekly program The sustainable and luxurious ADLER Spa Resorts & Lodges in Italy also believe in the benefits of sound baths and have made them an integral part of their wellness programs. “At ADLER Spa Resort SICILIA, we offer the ‘Gong Sound’ experience every Wednesday, Friday, and Saturday,” the team explains. “This treatment uses the slow, rhythmic beats of the gong, punctuated by brief moments of silence.” At the ADLER Lodge Ritten* the Klangbad takes place every Wednesday and Saturday. The location on the Ritten plateau in South Tyrol is ideal for combining an active vacation in nature with wellness. “You may find yourself taking a short but sweet nap during the sound treatments. The gentle sounds promote such a deep relaxation that a relaxed sleep is simply part of the experience, making it even more intense.” – ADLER Lodge RITTEN Sound bath as an included service The German hotel Das Rübezahl in the Allgäu region, like ADLER Spa Resorts & Lodges, offers sound baths as an included weekly program. In addition to the sound massage sessions, yoga and Qigong are also offered. Meditation with singing bowls Some Green PearlsⓇ hotels combine singing bowls with meditation. For example, the spa at CERVO Mountain Resort Zermatt in Switzerland offers a “singing bowl meditation” as part of its weekly yoga and meditation program. The sound bath helps calm the mind and release tension in the body. Guests leave feeling “more balanced and serene.” My Arbor* near Brixen in South Tyrol offers both singing bowl massage and singing bowl meditation. “It is a special form of relaxation that many of our guests love. They report feeling a deep sense of calm and lightness during the singing bowl treatment.” – Hotel My Arbor What is the difference between a singing bowl massage and a singing bowl meditation? The Keemala Resort on the island of Phuket in Thailand has answered this question. According to the resort, singing bowl massage is more about relaxing the muscles and stimulating circulation, while singing bowl meditation focuses on the mind. The goal of meditation is to achieve “mental clarity” through sounds and vibrations. Sound Healing Retreats If you want to delve deeper into the world of singing bowl healing, there are also a few retreats available. The Hotel Klosterhof – Alpine Hideaway & Spa hosted its first “Sound Healing Retreat” with Lisa Schuster, a physician and sound therapist from Munich. The three-night retreat included various sound baths, singing bowl massage, singing bowl meditation, toning exercises, yoga, and a cocoa ceremony. At the Gut Sonnenhausen near Munich, Germany, singing bowls and cocoa ceremonies were also combined during the “Finding Peace Day Retreat” held in the fall of 2024. The retreat was led by Thails de la Paz, who works regularly with the Sonnenhausen Estate. Sustainable wellness hotels with a Far Eastern touch Yoga, mindfulness, TCM, Ayurveda, singing bowls – much of the modern Western lifestyle has its origins in East Asia. In addition to the Okelmann’s, Grafenast, and HUBERTUS Mountain Refugio hotels already mentioned, the Green PearlsⓇ hotels, which are sustainably and individually managed, include many others inspired by Far Eastern culture. Stephan Bode, owner of the SCHWARZWALD PANORAMA in Bad Herrenalb, Germany, draws his personal strength from the words of Buddha and has integrated a Selfness Center into the hotel. Here, guests are offered mindfulness training, resilience, forest bathing, and fasting cures. Singing bowl massages are an optional extra. Heiner Buckermann designed the entire Lifestyle Resort Zum Kurfürsten in Bernkastel-Kues on the Mosel River according to Feng Shui (with the help of a Chinese master). He also integrated a TCM center into the hotel. He places great importance on the 5 elements and wants the life energy Qi to flow freely throughout the hotel. Among the treatments available at the TCM Center is a singing bowl massage based on the 5 elements. “Based on the five elements of traditional Chinese medicine, the goal is to achieve a healing balance of the organs, which stimulates the organism to regenerate itself. By placing and striking the body with singing bowls of different sizes, (…) qi, blood and emotions can flow freely again.” – Lifestyle Resort Zum Kurfürsten A 30-minute sound massage costs 47 euros. Singing bowl massage in Nepal The Himalayan region of Nepal is where Peter Hess was introduced to singing bowls and where the trend that is sweeping the West began. At the Pavilions Himalayas – The Farm you can experience the original Nepalese version of the singing bowl treatment. The sustainably managed resort is known for its yoga classes with Yogi Shyam Gurung, who we featured in our Yoga for pros blog post. His retreats are not only about physical exercises but also about a theoretical, traditional understanding of yoga. Sound bowls are used here in conjunction with meditation, Reiki, self-healing, and Ayurvedic treatments. “We offer yoga, meditation, and sound bowl sessions either as individual sessions or in small groups that know each other well,” the resort says. Singing bowl massage in Cambodia In Cambodia, you can receive a singing bowl massage at the Farmhouse Smiling Gecko. Buddhism is the state religion and singing bowls have a long tradition in Buddhism. It is said that singing bowls existed at the time of the historical Buddha. However, little is known about their exact origin and original meaning. At the luxurious Farmhouse Smiling Gecko Resort, you can experience the country authentically while supporting the Smiling Gecko Project. It supports the local population through training centers, a school, organic farming, and fair employment. Sound bowl meditation and science Finally, it is important to note that the effectiveness of a singing bowl massage is not scientifically proven and falls within the realm of alternative medicine. However, you may find that sometimes a beautiful sound is more pleasant than a long speech 🙂 *CIN: IT021072A1QCJQTLUQ (ADLER Lodge Ritten) *CIN: IT021011A1AE4737IT (My Arbor) Save this blog article on Pinterest"
The 5 most beautiful eco-luxury hotels in the Alps,"Want to be sustainable on vacation and be a model (sustainable) hotel guest? Then read on to find out what hoteliers are saying about what their valued guests should NOT do while on vacation 🙂 Support, not undermine, the efforts of sustainable hotels and accommodation When it comes to the do’s and don’ts of travel, this article looks at it from a sustainability perspective. In other articles of this kind, for example, one of the first rules is often: “Don’t dress like a tourist!” Trekking sandals and necklaces (as you probably know) are not considered fashionable – but from an ecological point of view, we don’t see a problem here! However, too much revealing clothing on vacation can offend the religious and cultural sensitivities of local people, as Indonesian Lucienne Anhar explains in our Bali blog post. On this blog, we feature privately and individually owned hotels and vacation rentals that demonstrate sustainable and environmentally friendly practices in all areas. You will often see small signs reminding you that you can do without fresh towels every day (a simple measure that contributes significantly to the conservation of energy, fresh water, and detergents in the tourism industry). But sometimes, as guests, we may not even be aware that our behavior is undermining the resort’s sustainability efforts in one way or another. So it’s time to ask our hotelier partners what we might want to avoid doing. Don’ts for a sustainable vacation at a hotel #1 Use your own shampoo At The Pavilions Himalayas – The Farm (just named one of the 22 “Absolute Best Hotels in Asia” by Fodor’s Travel), guests are not encouraged to use their own shampoo and shower gel. The simple reason is that the Nepalese resort is run according to ecological criteria and is surrounded by organic farmland. The water cycles of the farm, the kitchen, and the resort are all connected. Chemicals, pollutants, and microplastics, which are often found in many conventional shower products, can harm the farm, the hotel team explains. “We encourage our guests to use the bathroom products we provide because they are all natural and chemical free.” – The Pavilions Himalayas – The Farm #2 Balloons at hotel parties Have you ever considered that balloons are not environmentally friendly decorations or gifts? For this reason, they are not allowed on Gut Sonnenhausen in Glonn (near Munich). “We do a lot of weddings and one thing we don’t do is balloons. Since we are in the middle of a nature reserve, too many balloons and strings end up in the trees or on the ground, where they are nibbled by animals. But this is well accepted by our guests.” – Gut Sonnenhausen #3 Bringing snacks and food to the resort Don’t bring your own snacks, drinks, and take-out food to the resort – you might think, sure, they want to make money. But as Farmhouse Smiling Gecko in Cambodia tells us, they are particularly concerned about the packaging waste. The food that is brought in is usually wrapped in plastic, which ends up as garbage at the resort. And by the way, it’s not a bad thing to support the farmhouse and its Smiling Gecko project. It runs an organic farm, a school, and training centers for employees (or their children) and the local population on its premises. #4 Take bread from the breakfast buffet – yes or no? Should you take bread from the breakfast buffet to make a sandwich for lunch? Our Green PearlsⓇ partners have very different answers to this question, depending on the region in which the hotel is located. At the HUBERTUS Mountain Refugio Allgäu in Balderschwang, for example, the breakfast buffet offers extra “Jausesackerl”, which you can take with you for a snack on the mountain. At the Naturhotel Outside in East Tyrol, however, this is not welcomed. The hiking hotel is located in the middle of the Hohe Tauern Alpine National Park and believes it is important to support the local huts. For them, this is an aspect of economic and social sustainability. “We want our guests to stop and eat at the huts. That’s why we only offer a snack in the afternoon and don’t make snack packs to give away for hikes or anything like that.” – Naturhotel Outside #5 Smoking in Paris In Paris, people smoke a lot more than in other European cities. Every year, the city disposes of about 350 tons (!) of cigarette butts! The Green Spirit Hotels (Hotel Le Pavilions, Amelie and Malar, all in the lively 7th arrondissement, within walking distance of the Seine and the Eiffel Tower) are not happy about this. The small, independent hotels use special air filters to ensure fresh air, and smoking is only allowed in the green courtyard. Sometimes guests stub out their cigarettes in the flower pots! “Even though there are plenty of ashtrays outside!” In case you didn’t know, a cigarette butt is made of plastic and toxins, and especially when watering your plants, the toxins get into the plants, which is why you really shouldn’t do it! Neither in the garden nor outside (because the same thing happens there, only on a larger scale)! The correct place to dispose of them is the garbage. #6 Stealing hotel equipment as a “souvenir” – Please do not do this on vacation Do we really have to say that? Unfortunately, yes. Just on my last vacation (in a nature wagon in the Eifel) we asked the operator if we could have cutlery. “There is cutlery,” he was sure. But apparently, the previous tenants had taken it home… In 2023, the hotel portal Wellness Heaven conducted a survey of around 1,400 European hoteliers, which showed that towels and bathrobes are the most frequently taken items, especially in 5-star hotels. The AC Hotels by Marriott chain reported that approximately 1,250 towels per hotel (!) are stolen each year in a total of 64 hotels. Our partner, the aparthotel OLM Nature Escape in South Tyrol, only opened a year ago and is currently considering how to deal with this problem. “We place more trust in our valued guests than usual; we use valuable items and amenities. For example, a high quality sauna towel in the ApartSuite, high quality kitchen utensils, glasses, porcelain… Some guests take advantage of this and steal from us. They do not appreciate the generosity.” – OLM Nature Escape As you can see, the many little “oh, it won’t be noticed” actions of individual guests add up to a lot of damage, and are therefore clearly antisocial, unsustainable behavior, and things you shouldn’t do on vacation. (And you’re not legally allowed to do them either.) #7 Wasting energy At home, people conserve electricity because it costs money, and in hotels – it’s free. People who think like that don’t think very deeply. You would think that people who book sustainable hotels would have a certain sensitivity when it comes to conserving resources. Unfortunately, that is not necessarily the case. The Naturresort Gerbehof on Lake Constance is surprised by guests who “take showers several times a day, want their towels changed daily, or use a large number of towels in the sauna”. Hotel Bella Vista Zermatt in Switzerland also had guests who wanted their sheets changed “every day. Also sad is when guests “take too much food and then leave everything on the table”. Here are a few more tips for saving energy – at the hotel, too: #8 Trash “Waste is a big problem in general,” says Marco Spiess of Summit Lodges in Pfunds. Guests at the vacation homes in Pfunds, Tyrol, cook for themselves and bring their own food. The host notes: “In some cases, huge amounts of unopened food are thrown away, even though it is still fresh. He tries to point this out to his guests, but it often falls on “deaf ears”. The luxurious Keemala Resort in Thailand has a zero-waste policy and there are no plastic bottles, straws, or the like throughout the resort. Therefore, it is annoying when people bring plastic products from outside. It would also be desirable for guests to recycle their waste properly. There are signs of improvement The Lifestylehotel SAND in Timmendorfer Strand on the Baltic Sea has a positive story to tell about “guest education”. They started early to communicate their “sustainable lifestyle” both internally and to their guests. “It is important not to formulate prohibitions, but to ask for help.” – Marion Muller, Lifestlyhotel SAND She considers it a success that the demand for to-go cups, for example, has become an “exception”. The Biohotel Grafenast in Tyrol is also proud to report that it is very satisfied with the ecological awareness of its guests: „Most of our guests are very conscious of sustainability and live sustainably.“ – Biohotel Grafenast In general, you should continue to do the sustainable things you do at home while you are on vacation. Even though some sustainable practices may not be as common in the country where you are vacationing. “Going wild” on vacation is not trendy at the moment. And it never really has been. Do you have other experiences, examples, or tips for vacation dos and don’ts? Write them down in the comments!"
In the Gardens of our Green Pearls Partners,"On our blog we often talk about HOW to travel sustainable. Today, though, we want to talk about WHY it is important. We’ll give away this much: it’s not just about protecting the environment. Ultimately, sustainable travel benefits you personally. #1 Tourism as an economic factor The tourism industry is an important economic factor – in some countries it is the most important. Your vacation sets your money in motion, helping to redistribute wealth and pay workers. Hotels are often large businesses with many employees, subcontractors, suppliers, etc. who also benefit from a financially successful hotel. Unfortunately, not all hotels are sustainable and socially responsible, and often your money does not benefit your vacation destination at all. You may travel to a hotel in Thailand and your money ends up with an investor in the US or Japan. Some hotels employ seasonal workers who live in shabby accommodations (I was told this for a German island, for example). By consciously choosing a hotel that operates in a sustainable and usually fair manner, you ensure that your money really benefits the region and creates fair jobs. Support fair labor practices in hotels One example is the Green City Hotel Vauban in Freiburg, Germany. This sustainable city hotel is an integration project, and half of all employees are people with physical and/or mental disabilities. The hotel has deep roots in Freiburg. Its shareholders are the Vereinigung Freiburger Sozialarbeit e.V. and the Freiburger Stadtbau GmbH. Even abroad, you have many opportunities to use your purchasing power to help other people (instead of supporting their exploitation). At our Green PearlsⓇ partner Farmhouse Smiling Gecko in Cambodia, the luxury resort ensures the financing of the Smiling Gecko NGO’s training centers, school and organic farm, and also serves as a training center and employer itself. #2 preserving resources You probably already know this: Planet B does not exist. The idea that we could someday completely deplete our planet of all its resources, destroy all animal and plant species (and perhaps even entire populations), and live on Mars from then on is NOT realistic! Fossil resources such as oil, coal and natural gas are finite. This means that they are taken from the Earth and then they are gone. Theoretically, these resources will eventually reform, but in the case of oil, for example, it takes at least 10,000 years for new oil to form from dead plant matter and plankton. We should all be aware that what we consume today will not be available to our children, grandchildren, great-grandchildren and future generations. Renewable energy in the hospitality industry In our opinion, one of the requirements for a sustainable hotel is to run on renewable energy. The least you can do is get 100% green electricity (something you can easily do at home by simply switching your electricity provider). But many hotels go further. For example, our partner Hotel Milano Scala was the first Zero Emission Hotel in Italy. It is powered by geothermal energy, a renewable energy source that “significantly reduces greenhouse gas emissions,” according to the Ministry of the Environment, Climate and Energy. Other hotels and residences rely on their own combined heat and power plants, heat pump technologies, photovoltaic and solar thermal systems, and heat recovery measures to reduce their own consumption of fossil resources while minimizing CO2 emissions. Upcycling and organic Conserving resources is not only about energy, but also about buildings and furnishings. The HUBERTUS Mountain Refugio Allgäu recently renovated its hotel rooms using a sustainable upcycling concept. Instead of buying new furniture, the existing solid wood furniture in the rooms was simply dismantled, the (outdated) decorations removed and the furniture reworked. The new composition created modern furniture without cutting down any trees! (You can learn more about this in this YouTube video by owner Marc Traubel and interior designer Sarah Stapelfeld) Throughout Biohotel Grafenast you will find sustainable and natural materials such as solid wood and local stone. The eco-friendly hotel is also committed to organic farming and uses only organic food – whenever possible, directly from the region and from the hotel’s own “Sehnsuchtsgarten” (garden of longing). Short delivery distances mean fewer greenhouse gases, and the absence of pesticides helps preserve biodiversity. #3 Promote nature and species conservation Which brings us to the next argument: sustainable travel supports conservation. Take, for example, the Casa León Royal Retreat in Gran Canaria. This small boutique hotel in the interior of the island has created a garden of native plants on its 10,000-square-meter property and uses only natural pest control. Here you can see a variety of small animals, such as the Canary Island bullfinch – the original form of the domesticated canary! The hotel uses a rainwater cistern system for irrigation. In another sustainable initiative, the family that owns Casa León Royal Retreat has leased a 40,000-square-foot piece of forest in the Balkans that is maintained but still largely untouched. This has created another protected area for animals and plants in this world, which also helps the climate. #4 Experience the country and its people in an authentic way Sustainable travel means going off the beaten track and visiting places away from the usual mass tourism destinations. This gives you a real opportunity to experience the country you are visiting and get to know the locals. Albergi Diffusi is saving villages in Italy In Italy, the Albergo Diffuso movement has helped save Italian villages from decay. An Albergo Diffuso is a hotel spread over several buildings in a village. You live among the locals. Our Green PearlsⓇ partner Relais del Maro is a prime example. Owner Elena Scalambrin converted several of her family’s commercial and residential buildings into a 4-star hotel. Guests arrive at the main house with a reception for dinner (and the pool), but otherwise stay in lovingly decorated rooms in the middle of the village community. The hotel has helped keep the village bakery and other local businesses alive. Here you will be able to experience the real Liguria and see the positive effects of sustainable tourism at first hand. #5 Learning to love nature “In the end, we will conserve only what we love” – Baba Dioum, Senegalese forestry engineer and conservationist It is easy to understand Baba Dioum’s famous quote, delivered at a biodiversity conference in India in 1968. As we showed in our blog post on insect extinction, many animals and plants simply do not have a strong “lobby”. We think of some bugs and algae as expendable. It is only when we understand the important role they play that we learn to love them and work to conserve them. Guided hikes in the Allgäu At Hotel Das Rübezahl in Füssen, you have the opportunity to discover nature with the hotel’s own hiking guide. “Bergbaschdi” will take you into the mountains and show you the flora and fauna. You are sure to discover things you would otherwise have missed. (Read more in our interview with the hiking concierge) Experience glaciers live in Switzerland Glaciers are also very interesting. These “eternal” masses of ice are the largest reservoirs of fresh water on our planet, and they are in danger of disappearing! Fabienne Anthamatten of the Hotel Bella Vista Zermatt can tell you all about it. Her hotel has an 8,000-year-old larch tree that she found on a former glacier field. This means that the trunk was preserved in the ice for several thousand years and has now been uncovered. On a trip to the glaciers, you can admire the fascinating masses of ice (there are still many kilometers left) and better understand the connections to global warming. #6 Have a vision – and think about the future Just being in the present moment is a beautiful mindfulness exercise. But you should also have a vision in your life. A vision is a motivating, positive idea about the future. And that’s what sustainable travel is all about. According to the UN, sustainable tourism is: “Tourism that takes full account of its current and future economic, social and environmental impacts.” So it’s thinking about the NOW as well as the FUTURE and taking responsibility for it. If you can do that, you’re doing pretty well. And what better way to learn how to do that and develop your own vision of the future than to travel the world sustainably and be inspired by other visionaries? If that’s not a good argument for sustainable travel, I don’t know what is? Save this article to Pinterest and share it with your friends!

Peru: From the rain forest to the cloud forest and Machu Picchu,"Whether you are sitting in the grass dreaming, simply looking out of the window or having a walk in the park looking out for local birds – there is nothing more relaxing than bird watching. It is particularly interesting if you are in the company of an expert who is able to to draw your attention to birds you wouldn’t have spotted yourself or to recognize their call. Some hotels offer guided bird watching tours – and thus also give you the opportunity to see exotic or rare birds as well. Watching birds – and protecting them In Peru, more than 1,800 bird species are registered; that is approximately 20 % of all bird species worldwide. Here, the Inkaterra Asociación is dedicated to the study and conservation of the local Flora and Fauna. On the huge property of Inkaterra Machu Picchu Pueblo Hotel, 214 different bird species live in their natural habitat, the property of Inkaterra Reserva Amazónica even counts 540 species. On different tours, each accompanied by a specialist in bird and nature observation, you can watch local birds, such as the blazing red Cock-of-the-Rock, and various kinds of migratory birds. And as Inkaterra Asociación is financed by tourism-activities, you also contribute to the conservation of this colorful variety. It couldn’t be greener: vacations in the jungle A natural retreat Other hotels, too, are committed to the protection of local nature. For example, during the construction of the Morena Eco Resort on Curaçao, 80 % of the natural vegetation on the ample property has been preserved. Numerous tropical birds and other native animal species visit Morena Eco Resort from the adjoining nature reserve. The situation is similar at Tongsai Bay on Koh Samui: the resort is surrounded by 28,5 acres of natural landscape, which is home to more than 60 different species of bird. Here, they can feel at ease, as Tongsai Bay attaches great importance to the protection of their natural habitat and provides medical treatment if sick or injured animals are found. Where birds are welcome The bird-friendly resort Coconut Lagoon has installed nest-boxes on branches of trees around its property to provide nesting facilities for local birds such as Magpie Robin or Common Myna. There are countless birds in the garden of Coconut Lagoon that do not only fascinate by their appearance but also by their extraordinary names: among others the Red-vented Bulbul, Purple-rumped sunbird, Crow-Pheasant and Black-headed Oriole have their homes here. Wetland birds are very active in the canals and the paddy-fields of the Coconut Lagoon. Naturalists will accompany you on your walks and provide you with details on the flora and fauna of the region. Spectacular terrace view From the restaurant terrace of Amaya Hunas Falls in Sri Lanka, with a bit of luck you can watch majestic birds such as the White Bellied Sea Eagle. The hotel is also a perfect starting point for trips to two amazing bird-watching destinations: Horton Plains National Park, which is a UNESCO World Heritage Site, and Peradeniya Royal Botancial Gardens, Sri Lanka’s largest botanical garden. Chance meetings and planned ones You can usually look forward to encounters with some feathered friends when you stay at a hotel close to nature. And if you want to benefit from expert knowledge, it’s always worth taking a look at the hotel’s events calendar. For example, the Swiss hotel Schloss Wartegg offers a tour accompanied by the bird-watching expert Gieri Battaglia on April 28th, 2018. And if you book a room facing the forest next to Schloss Wartegg, you can be sure of an early morning bird concert. Do you like this post? Share it!"

5 accommodations for sustainable sleep in ancient masonry,"The average German spends about 3.5 hours a day looking at the cell phone! At least, that’s according to an online study by ARD/ZDF. And you? Just a quick check of the mails – then a quick look at Instagram and WhatsApp, quickly shopping for the birthday present for the girlfriend and streaming the latest Netflix series in the evening.

Peru: From the rain forest to the cloud forest and Machu Picchu,"Whether you are sitting in the grass dreaming, simply looking out of the window or having a walk in the park looking out for local birds – there is nothing more relaxing than bird watching. It is particularly interesting if you are in the company of an expert who is able to to draw your attention to birds you wouldn’t have spotted yourself or to recognize their call. Some hotels offer guided bird watching tours – and thus also give you the opportunity to see exotic or rare birds as well. Watching birds – and protecting them In Peru, more than 1,800 bird species are registered; that is approximately 20 % of all bird species worldwide. Here, the Inkaterra Asociación is dedicated to the study and conservation of the local Flora and Fauna. On the huge property of Inkaterra Machu Picchu Pueblo Hotel, 214 different bird species live in their natural habitat, the property of Inkaterra Reserva Amazónica even counts 540 species. On different tours, each accompanied by a specialist in bird and nature observation, you can watch local birds, such as the blazing red Cock-of-the-Rock, and various kinds of migratory birds. And as Inkaterra Asociación is financed by tourism-activities, you also contribute to the conservation of this colorful variety. It couldn’t be greener: vacations in the jungle A natural retreat Other hotels, too, are committed to the protection of local nature. For example, during the construction of the Morena Eco Resort on Curaçao, 80 % of the natural vegetation on the ample property has been preserved. Numerous tropical birds and other native animal species visit Morena Eco Resort from the adjoining nature reserve. The situation is similar at Tongsai Bay on Koh Samui: the resort is surrounded by 28,5 acres of natural landscape, which is home to more than 60 different species of bird. Here, they can feel at ease, as Tongsai Bay attaches great importance to the protection of their natural habitat and provides medical treatment if sick or injured animals are found. Where birds are welcome The bird-friendly resort Coconut Lagoon has installed nest-boxes on branches of trees around its property to provide nesting facilities for local birds such as Magpie Robin or Common Myna. There are countless birds in the garden of Coconut Lagoon that do not only fascinate by their appearance but also by their extraordinary names: among others the Red-vented Bulbul, Purple-rumped sunbird, Crow-Pheasant and Black-headed Oriole have their homes here. Wetland birds are very active in the canals and the paddy-fields of the Coconut Lagoon. Naturalists will accompany you on your walks and provide you with details on the flora and fauna of the region. Spectacular terrace view From the restaurant terrace of Amaya Hunas Falls in Sri Lanka, with a bit of luck you can watch majestic birds such as the White Bellied Sea Eagle. The hotel is also a perfect starting point for trips to two amazing bird-watching destinations: Horton Plains National Park, which is a UNESCO World Heritage Site, and Peradeniya Royal Botancial Gardens, Sri Lanka’s largest botanical garden. Chance meetings and planned ones You can usually look forward to encounters with some feathered friends when you stay at a hotel close to nature. And if you want to benefit from expert knowledge, it’s always worth taking a look at the hotel’s events calendar. For example, the Swiss hotel Schloss Wartegg offers a tour accompanied by the bird-watching expert Gieri Battaglia on April 28th, 2018. And if you book a room facing the forest next to Schloss Wartegg, you can be sure of an early morning bird concert. Do you like this post? Share it!"
Impressive Thailand: visiting the Black Lahu in Ban Jabo,"Have you already planned your next vacation? Or are you still thinking about where to travel next – and above all, when? To make it easier for you to decide, this year we created a green travel calendar again, including tips on sustainable destinations that protect the environment and support local people and culture. Since January is almost over, we start with our tips for February. Travel calendar February: carnival under the Carribean sun Yes, that’s right: carnival is not only celebrated in Köln and Rio de Janeiro, but also in the Carribean! The biggest and longest carnival event takes place on Curacao: the sequence of colorful parades lasts almost a whole month. Its absolute highlight is the final parade that takes place in the evening and creates an almost magical atmosphere with its illuminated waggons. If you are looking for a quiet place as an offset, Morena Eco Resort is the perfect place. Here, you can enjoy the soft sand and the deep blue sea due to its location right at Jan Thiel beach. Alternatively you can explore the surrounding nature on foot or by mountain bike – passing tropical plants and animals. Travel calendar March: a hiking trip through the Atlas Mountains It takes only 25 minutes from Marrakesh to the impressive Atlas Mountains. Spring is the best season for hiking or biking tours in this area, when the temperature is pleasantly warm, but not too hot yet. At the foot of the Toubkal, the highest peak of the Atlas Mountains with 4.167 meters, there is a former Berber fortress, which today houses the Kasbah du Toubkal. In close proximity to a small village, you will live among locals and discover their culture. The guided hiking tours offered by the Kasbah du Toubkal are highly recommendable as well: on the first day you walk past bright green fields and spectacular canyons to a remote lodge, where you stay overnight. On the next day you set out for the journey back. Travel calendar April: water everywhere – Songkran in Thailand Songkran is the Thai New Year festival, taking place from 13th to 15th April. During these days, the whole country is out and about and enjoys high-spirited water fights. As soon as you go out onto the streets, you will certainly get “a bit” wet, too – luckily, this won’t be a problem due to the warm temperature. By the way, this tradition originates from Buddhism: in the past, the water used to clean Buddha statues in temples was collected and sprinkled over family members. This was regarded as a symbol for luck and spiritual purity. After all the excitement, Tongsai Bay on Koh Samui is the perfect place for a relaxed start into the New Year: sipping a delicious cocktail from a drinking straw made of lemon grass, you can enjoy the sea view from the bay in a relaxed atmosphere. Travel calendar May: a treat for body and soul In spring, people do not only get their houses in shipshape-condition – it is also the ideal time to pamper body and soul. At Wellnesshotel Seeschlößchen at Lake Senftenberg, you can thoroughly relax: the holistic concept with a focus on Ayurveda provides the perfect basis for the wide range of wellness treatments – be it the Russian Banya, the Oriental Rasul or the Hamam. The herbal sauna infusion is prepared from herbs from the own garden and the hotel uses regional ingredients for its Ayurveda food. Having spent a few days at Seeschlößchen, you will definitely feel completely relaxed!

The 5 most beautiful eco-luxury hotels in the Alps,"Clean beaches and seas, unspoiled nature in the mountains – that’s what tourists want. And hotels want to deliver. The problem is that the hotel industry itself is a major source of plastic waste. Single-use plastics in the form of typical hotel slippers, small packages in the bathroom and at the buffet, along with straws and cups, add up to mountains of plastic in conventional hotels. We took a look at sustainable Green PearlsⓇ hotels, what alternatives are available and how to avoid single-use plastics in general. The problem with disposables in hotels When you stay at a hotel, you get everything you need: your luggage is taken care of, a refreshing drink is waiting for you in your room, a variety of toiletries are available in the bathroom, towels and slippers are provided… and while you are lying by the pool or sitting in the restaurant, your room is cleaned, the bed is made and all opened tubes and packages are replaced with new ones. Sound great? For sustainability-minded travelers like you, probably not. Because: All of this (among other things) creates a lot of waste. Hotels and vacation rentals definitely have a single-use problem, and it has to do with the following:: Expensive hotels produce less waste than cheap ones According to the DEHOGA environmental brochure, 0 to 2-star hotels produce 9.1 liters of waste per guest per day, 4-star hotels 3.4 liters (5-star hotels produce slightly more at 3.7 liters). According to the German Hotel and Restaurant Association (DEHOGA), this is mainly due to disposable packaging in the lower star categories. In the upscale hotel industry, less disposable packaging is used simply for style’s sake – e.g. cloth napkins instead of paper napkins, ceramic or stainless steel milk jugs instead of plastic condensed milk containers, etc. But simply choosing a higher star rating is not enough to eliminate waste and single-use packaging. Especially since not everyone can or wants to. Above all, it takes hoteliers who really care and are committed to reducing waste in their properties. Zero waste or at least “less waste” is a central concern for Green Pearls® accommodations. Each accommodation has its own approach to waste reduction, which you can read about on the Green Pearls® pages and on their individual websites. As mentioned above, many of them are Zero Waste representatives, striving for a low environmental footprint and a circular economy in all areas. We believe that Green PearlsⓇ hotels are among the lowest waste producers in the industry. “In terms of waste and plastic reduction, sustainably certified hotels are generally more advanced than non-certified hotels.” – WWF WWF study on single-use and reusable products in the hospitality industry In 2019 and 2024, WWF Germany investigated the issue of single-use plastics in the hotel industry. For the 2019 study, WWF surveyed hotels and hotel guests in Italy, France, Greece and Spain. In 2024, the data was supplemented by expert interviews and a literature review. It found that the majority of guests use significantly more reusable packaging at home than on vacation. Hoteliers are determined to act, but face many obstacles: For every 50 million disposables, only half a million reusables are sold “In 2022, the share of reusable packaging (by number of items) in the hotel industry was only 1.2 percent. (600,000 items compared to 50.6 million disposable items) and consisted almost entirely of beverage containers.” – Untersuchung der Gesellschaft für Verpackungsmarktforschung mbH (GVM) für den WWF All too often, “habit” is to blame for not using reusable products. By the way, the WWF believes that reusable products make much more sense than disposable products made from “eco-materials”. In other words, a refillable plastic bottle is better than a disposable bamboo cup. Washable cloth napkins are better than disposable napkins made from recycled cellulose. This is how sustainable hotels avoid disposable packaging Amenities upon request Many sustainable hotels and resorts have started to remove amenities such as toothbrushes, razors, sewing kits, etc. from the rooms and store them at the front desk. That way, you still get them, but only if you really need and ask for them. “By providing standard amenities only upon request, we avoid unnecessary use,” says Farmhouse Smiling Gecko in Cambodia. The resort also offers many homemade products from the resort’s own workshops, which Smiling Gecko uses to support the local community. When it comes to the amenities that are still offered on request, sustainable accommodation also ensures that they are produced sustainably and fairly. This is what the Naturresort Gerbehof in Friedrichshafen on Lake Constance reports. Honesty bar with reusable glasses instead of a minibar The minibar is another element that must be provided to meet hotel standards. In addition to energy consumption, drinks and snacks in disposable packaging also have a negative impact on the environment. Gut Guntrams near Vienna therefore installed a “central minibar” in the form of a Honesty Bar and left the individual minibars in the rooms empty. The Honesty Bar offers homemade sweet and savory treats in reusable glass jars. Homemade welcome cookies A small welcome gift for guests is a nice touch. But as Zero Waste advocate Béá Johnson says, promotional gifts and giveaways are often a source of waste. Not so at the Hotel Bella Vista Zermatt in Switzerland. There, homemade cookies on a plate greet guests in the mountains near the Matterhorn. A water bottle for the duration of your stay Many hotels provide their guests with a refillable water bottle. At the OCÉANO Health Spa Hotel on Tenerife, the “OCÉANO Glass Bottle” is available and there are water dispensers throughout the hotel where you can refill the bottle with fresh, filtered water. This fits in with the wide range of sports and wellness activities on offer and also saves a lot of bottles and miles of transportation 🙂 Source of waste: breakfast buffet? Zero waste is also an option! One of the biggest contributors to packaging and food waste in the hotel industry is the breakfast buffet. All Green Pearls® hotels have optimized this aspect. “There are no packaged products at our breakfast buffet,” reports the APIPURA hotel rinner on the ritten in South Tyrol. Instead, the child-friendly hotel offers organic products in small jars – one of the highlights are the various types of organic honey from the hotel’s own beekeeping. Zero waste measures at the breakfast buffet: Elimination of disposable hygiene products Disposable bathroom hygiene products are the second major area where mountains of plastic waste accumulate in conventional hotels. This refers to the small packages of shampoo, shower gel, soap, body lotion, shower cap, toothbrush, razor and so on. Sustainable hotels show that these products can be provided to guests in a stylish and hygienic way and do not have to be the norm. Solid Soap and Shampoo At the Klosterhof Alpine Hideaway & Spa in Berchtesgadener Land, Bavaria, the bathroom features soap and shampoo bars, as well as refillable shower gel dispensers as an alternative to traditional bottles. You can do the same at home, by the way! Dispenser Speaking of dispensers: Another option you might want to consider for the home are refillable, larger, and often more attractive dispensers for soap, shampoo, conditioner, shower gel, and the like. According to soap manufacturer MarcelsGreenSoap, a refill bag saves 85% of plastic packaging! Almost all Green Pearls® accommodations now use dispensers – with natural ingredients. “Our shampoos and shower gels (in the dispensers) are from Tiroler Kräuterhof, so they are 100% natural and regional,” reports Summit Lodges Pfunds. Biohotel Grafenast in Tyrol even offers dispensers with arnica muscle gel for relaxation after long hikes around the Pillberg 😉 Natural cosmetics free of chemicals and microplastics For our Green PearlsⓇ partners, the use of environmentally friendly cosmetic products is very important. At Pavilions Himalayas – The Farm in Nepal, you can buy bamboo toothbrushes with hemp bristles and plastic-free toothpaste tabs made according to Ayurvedic principles, as are the other personal care products. Avoiding chemicals and microplastics is particularly important to them to protect the water quality of their organic farm.. The Green Spirit hotels in Paris (Hotel Malar, Hotel Amelie and Hotel Le Pavillon, all in the central 7th arrondissement within walking distance of the Eiffel Tower) use soaps, shampoos and shower gels from Austrian natural cosmetics company Pure Green. The luxurious Klosterbräu wellness hotel in Seefeld, Tyrol, spoils its guests with premium products from Augustinus Bader – some of which have been developed exclusively for the hotel. The Lifestylehotel SAND in Timmendorfer Strand on the Baltic Sea has embraced ‘Björk&Berries‘. Nordic, sustainable, refillable and stylish,” they say. Food from their own harvest In the hotel industry, buying food in bulk is one way to reduce unnecessary packaging. Where possible, regionally. “We work almost exclusively with local suppliers to avoid long transport routes and support the regional economy,” says My Arbor near Brixen in South Tyrol. However, food packaging is avoided in particular through direct in-house production. “From cakes to chocolates to syrups, we make everything ourselves,” explains the adults-only wellness hotel. “All our fresh fruit and vegetables come from our own farm in Albisano on Lake Garda. The owner, Mr Huber, personally takes care of the harvest and brings the produce directly to the hotel (without packaging waste) so that our guests can enjoy the freshest ingredients.” – My Arbor Dishes and glasses Disposable plastic cups at hotels? They do exist! Some hoteliers find them more convenient and less risky than glass or porcelain, especially for the lawn or pool. Unfortunately, they create a huge amount of waste. Sustainable hotels are careful to use only high-quality, plastic-free materials. The energy-independent aparthotel OLM Nature Escape in Sand in Taufers, South Tyrol, uses only glass, porcelain, ceramic, clay and enamel for food and drink. Tablecloths and napkins Just as glass and porcelain are more stylish than plastic tableware, cloth napkins are more sophisticated than paper napkins. You can find them, for example, at the Relais del Maro in Liguria. The Albergo Diffuso in the picturesque village of Borgomaro takes care to avoid waste in all areas. Consequently, linen tablecloths are washed rather than thrown away. Towel change upon request only Since laundry does not produce waste, but does use detergent, water and energy, daily hotel laundry is another factor that you, as a guest, can help with. Many guests notice that even towels that have been hung up are all replaced the next day. This calls for well-trained staff who, like at the Lifestyle Resort Zum Kurfürsten on the Mosel, change towels only when requested. Even in the large wellness area with sauna and several pools, guests are asked to use sauna towels sparingly and sometimes several times. Forgoing daily room cleaning and turn-down service Similarly, as a guest, you can support a hotel’s sustainability efforts by choosing not to have your room cleaned daily. In most cases, you have to explicitly decline. For example, the sustainable Hotel Luise in Erlangen, Germany, tried to switch to opt-in (i.e., you get daily room cleaning only if you want it), but that would have meant being stripped of all their hotel stars by the Hotel Stars Union! However, at the ADLER Lodge RITTEN in South Tyrol (a luxurious all-inclusive resort close to nature), the turndown service has become an opt-in offer. This means that rooms are only prepared in the evening if you, the guest, specifically request it. No slippers The slippers provided in a hotel’s spa area are disposable products that generate huge amounts of waste. According to the German magazine Focus, the Steigenberger Hotels alone (a total of 60 hotels and resorts) would order 180,000 pairs of slippers for their guests each year. One can only imagine the mountain of slipper waste in the entire industry! The HUBERTUS Mountain Refugio Allgäu has therefore removed the slippers from the rooms and will only provide them upon request. Instead, guests are asked to bring their own. The romantic Hotel Das Rübezahl in Füssen, Germany, takes a similar approach to the slipper issue: guests are only provided with hotel slippers for the spa upon request, and the slippers are made of linen and cork, making them compostable. Backpack and shopping bag provided In many vacation destinations, plastic bags are still the norm. Even though a lot of plastic waste could be avoided! That is why CERVO Mountain Resort Zermatt in Switzerland provides guests with both a backpack for hiking and reusable bags for shopping. Digital Guest Magazine Digitization also reduces waste. Guests receive a digital reservation confirmation, there is a digital guest magazine and digital services. At the Eco-Hotel Okelmann’s, for example, you can download Komoot maps created by Senior Okelmann to your phone so you can start cycling right away. The Hotel Klosterbräu in Seefeld, Tyrol, has a guest channel on the hotel TV where you can find out about all the events and offers at the hotel. Offering waste separation for guests As mentioned at the beginning, many people use more disposable items on vacation than at home. Recycling is also often not as successful on vacation. However, this is not always the guests’ fault… You may have experienced the situation where there is only one disposable waste bin in the hotel room and you don’t even have the opportunity to separate your own waste. Some hotels may also think that their international guests don’t know how to it. Not so at Keemala on the island of Phuket in Thailand. “We have clearly marked recycling and waste stations throughout the resort, making it easy for guests to dispose of their waste properly,” they wrote to us. Unlike many internationally managed hotels on the island of Phuket, Keemala is owned by a local family who are very conscious of their impact on the environment. The 5-star ADLER Lodge RITTEN is another example of how in-room waste separation can be done in style. Toilet paper made out of Tetra Pak According to Statista, global per capita consumption of toilet paper reach almost 14 kilograms per person in 2023. However, in Germany, the figure is much higher, at 30.6 kilograms per person. A lot of trees have to be cut down to produce all this fresh fiber. The SCHWARZWALD PANORAMA in Bad Herrenalb has switched to toilet paper made from recycled beverage cartons. This reflects the concept of recycling that the wellness and selfness hotel also applies to its room furnishings. Wooden coffee pods eliminate single-use plastics Coffee capsule machines are definitely not the most sustainable way to make coffee. However, they are a great solution for allowing guests in a hotel suite to make their own coffee. The Birkenhof***** Spa and Genuss Resort uses Rezemo wooden coffee capsules. They contain coffee from sustainable sources. The other amenities of the 5-star wellness hotel are packaged in plastic-free cardboard as well. Zero-Waste Goodbye Gift When you leave, hotels often give you a small parting gift – and that too is a source of packaging waste. Of course, sustainable hotels have also thought about how to give you, the guest, a gift that is both beautiful and environmentally friendly. At the Naturhotel Outside in the Hohe Tauern National Park in East Tyrol, Austria, guests receive a jar of homemade jam in a reusable glass jar. The Hotel Weihrerhof in South Tyrol, on the Italian side of the Alps, offers soaps from its own organic cosmetics line, BergSea, which uses water from the Wolfsgruben Lake, located directly in front of the hotel. “We want our guests to take the soaps home with them and continue to dream of the Weihrerhof,” says the host family. As you can see, Green PearlsⓇ hotels have put a lot of thought into how they can eliminate single-use items, waste and plastic, which means you may use no more single-use items on your vacation than you would at home – in fact, you may use fewer items than at home!"
The 5 most beautiful eco-luxury hotels in the Alps,"Want to be sustainable on vacation and be a model (sustainable) hotel guest? Then read on to find out what hoteliers are saying about what their valued guests should NOT do while on vacation 🙂 Support, not undermine, the efforts of sustainable hotels and accommodation When it comes to the do’s and don’ts of travel, this article looks at it from a sustainability perspective. In other articles of this kind, for example, one of the first rules is often: “Don’t dress like a tourist!” Trekking sandals and necklaces (as you probably know) are not considered fashionable – but from an ecological point of view, we don’t see a problem here! However, too much revealing clothing on vacation can offend the religious and cultural sensitivities of local people, as Indonesian Lucienne Anhar explains in our Bali blog post. On this blog, we feature privately and individually owned hotels and vacation rentals that demonstrate sustainable and environmentally friendly practices in all areas. You will often see small signs reminding you that you can do without fresh towels every day (a simple measure that contributes significantly to the conservation of energy, fresh water, and detergents in the tourism industry). But sometimes, as guests, we may not even be aware that our behavior is undermining the resort’s sustainability efforts in one way or another. So it’s time to ask our hotelier partners what we might want to avoid doing. Don’ts for a sustainable vacation at a hotel #1 Use your own shampoo At The Pavilions Himalayas – The Farm (just named one of the 22 “Absolute Best Hotels in Asia” by Fodor’s Travel), guests are not encouraged to use their own shampoo and shower gel. The simple reason is that the Nepalese resort is run according to ecological criteria and is surrounded by organic farmland. The water cycles of the farm, the kitchen, and the resort are all connected. Chemicals, pollutants, and microplastics, which are often found in many conventional shower products, can harm the farm, the hotel team explains. “We encourage our guests to use the bathroom products we provide because they are all natural and chemical free.” – The Pavilions Himalayas – The Farm #2 Balloons at hotel parties Have you ever considered that balloons are not environmentally friendly decorations or gifts? For this reason, they are not allowed on Gut Sonnenhausen in Glonn (near Munich). “We do a lot of weddings and one thing we don’t do is balloons. Since we are in the middle of a nature reserve, too many balloons and strings end up in the trees or on the ground, where they are nibbled by animals. But this is well accepted by our guests.” – Gut Sonnenhausen #3 Bringing snacks and food to the resort Don’t bring your own snacks, drinks, and take-out food to the resort – you might think, sure, they want to make money. But as Farmhouse Smiling Gecko in Cambodia tells us, they are particularly concerned about the packaging waste. The food that is brought in is usually wrapped in plastic, which ends up as garbage at the resort. And by the way, it’s not a bad thing to support the farmhouse and its Smiling Gecko project. It runs an organic farm, a school, and training centers for employees (or their children) and the local population on its premises. #4 Take bread from the breakfast buffet – yes or no? Should you take bread from the breakfast buffet to make a sandwich for lunch? Our Green PearlsⓇ partners have very different answers to this question, depending on the region in which the hotel is located. At the HUBERTUS Mountain Refugio Allgäu in Balderschwang, for example, the breakfast buffet offers extra “Jausesackerl”, which you can take with you for a snack on the mountain. At the Naturhotel Outside in East Tyrol, however, this is not welcomed. The hiking hotel is located in the middle of the Hohe Tauern Alpine National Park and believes it is important to support the local huts. For them, this is an aspect of economic and social sustainability. “We want our guests to stop and eat at the huts. That’s why we only offer a snack in the afternoon and don’t make snack packs to give away for hikes or anything like that.” – Naturhotel Outside #5 Smoking in Paris In Paris, people smoke a lot more than in other European cities. Every year, the city disposes of about 350 tons (!) of cigarette butts! The Green Spirit Hotels (Hotel Le Pavilions, Amelie and Malar, all in the lively 7th arrondissement, within walking distance of the Seine and the Eiffel Tower) are not happy about this. The small, independent hotels use special air filters to ensure fresh air, and smoking is only allowed in the green courtyard. Sometimes guests stub out their cigarettes in the flower pots! “Even though there are plenty of ashtrays outside!” In case you didn’t know, a cigarette butt is made of plastic and toxins, and especially when watering your plants, the toxins get into the plants, which is why you really shouldn’t do it! Neither in the garden nor outside (because the same thing happens there, only on a larger scale)! The correct place to dispose of them is the garbage. #6 Stealing hotel equipment as a “souvenir” – Please do not do this on vacation Do we really have to say that? Unfortunately, yes. Just on my last vacation (in a nature wagon in the Eifel) we asked the operator if we could have cutlery. “There is cutlery,” he was sure. But apparently, the previous tenants had taken it home… In 2023, the hotel portal Wellness Heaven conducted a survey of around 1,400 European hoteliers, which showed that towels and bathrobes are the most frequently taken items, especially in 5-star hotels. The AC Hotels by Marriott chain reported that approximately 1,250 towels per hotel (!) are stolen each year in a total of 64 hotels. Our partner, the aparthotel OLM Nature Escape in South Tyrol, only opened a year ago and is currently considering how to deal with this problem. “We place more trust in our valued guests than usual; we use valuable items and amenities. For example, a high quality sauna towel in the ApartSuite, high quality kitchen utensils, glasses, porcelain… Some guests take advantage of this and steal from us. They do not appreciate the generosity.” – OLM Nature Escape As you can see, the many little “oh, it won’t be noticed” actions of individual guests add up to a lot of damage, and are therefore clearly antisocial, unsustainable behavior, and things you shouldn’t do on vacation. (And you’re not legally allowed to do them either.) #7 Wasting energy At home, people conserve electricity because it costs money, and in hotels – it’s free. People who think like that don’t think very deeply. You would think that people who book sustainable hotels would have a certain sensitivity when it comes to conserving resources. Unfortunately, that is not necessarily the case. The Naturresort Gerbehof on Lake Constance is surprised by guests who “take showers several times a day, want their towels changed daily, or use a large number of towels in the sauna”. Hotel Bella Vista Zermatt in Switzerland also had guests who wanted their sheets changed “every day. Also sad is when guests “take too much food and then leave everything on the table”. Here are a few more tips for saving energy – at the hotel, too: #8 Trash “Waste is a big problem in general,” says Marco Spiess of Summit Lodges in Pfunds. Guests at the vacation homes in Pfunds, Tyrol, cook for themselves and bring their own food. The host notes: “In some cases, huge amounts of unopened food are thrown away, even though it is still fresh. He tries to point this out to his guests, but it often falls on “deaf ears”. The luxurious Keemala Resort in Thailand has a zero-waste policy and there are no plastic bottles, straws, or the like throughout the resort. Therefore, it is annoying when people bring plastic products from outside. It would also be desirable for guests to recycle their waste properly. There are signs of improvement The Lifestylehotel SAND in Timmendorfer Strand on the Baltic Sea has a positive story to tell about “guest education”. They started early to communicate their “sustainable lifestyle” both internally and to their guests. “It is important not to formulate prohibitions, but to ask for help.” – Marion Muller, Lifestlyhotel SAND She considers it a success that the demand for to-go cups, for example, has become an “exception”. The Biohotel Grafenast in Tyrol is also proud to report that it is very satisfied with the ecological awareness of its guests: „Most of our guests are very conscious of sustainability and live sustainably.“ – Biohotel Grafenast In general, you should continue to do the sustainable things you do at home while you are on vacation. Even though some sustainable practices may not be as common in the country where you are vacationing. “Going wild” on vacation is not trendy at the moment. And it never really has been. Do you have other experiences, examples, or tips for vacation dos and don’ts? Write them down in the comments!"
The 5 most beautiful eco-luxury hotels in the Alps,"Want to go on vacation and leave a smaller carbon footprint? Great! Many sustainable hotels and vacation rentals will help you get to your destination by eco-friendly train – for example, with a first-class upgrade or a free electric shuttle to the nearest train station. In this article, we show you the different incentives and support options available through Green Pearls® partner accommodations. Extra tip: Book directly with the hotel and get help with your arrival First, a general tip for green and fair travel: Book your accommodations directly through the hotel’s website. It’s no secret that travel sites like Booking.com take a commission from hotels when you book through them. So while you pay the same room rate, the hotels get less of it. The sustainable accommodations featured in this article are all personally and individually managed and you can contact them directly – you will find links to their websites on the Green PearlsⓇ microsites that we link to here. Our tip for traveling by train: Contact the hotel or vacation rental before you book (by email or phone). Tell them you are booking directly with them, that you are coming by train, and ask if there is anything they can do to help you travel green. Often there are special offers, such as a day of free e-bike use, or you can “beat” a free shuttle ☺️ Especially if you are staying longer, a sustainable accommodation will often meet you halfway. How sustainable accommodations reward and support you when you travel by train Upgrade to first class for the train ride to Zermatt Car-free Zermatt in Switzerland is the perfect destination for a vacation close to nature by train. The Visp-Zermatt line is considered to be a particularly picturesque route through the Swiss picture-book countryside ( like a route of these routes that you can watch on YouTube to relax). The boutique hotel, with a small spa and views of the Matterhorn, is run by the Anthamatten family and is committed to sustainability in all areas (e.g. zero waste principles and regional organic products). Free public transportation pass or guest card Another great offer from eco-friendly hotels are free local transportation passes – so you can get around in a climate-friendly way during your stay. Eco-friendly accommodation and transportation in Freiburg The Green City Hotel Vauban in the beautiful German city of Freiburg im Breisgau is an example of this. The modern city hotel with its green facade is easily accessible by train. Take the train to Freiburg’s main station and from there the number 3 tram to Paula-Modersohn-Platz – the stop is right in front of the hotel. Green PearlsⓇ hotels on the Ritten in South Tyrol offer you the RittenCard The Ritten Plateau in South Tyrol is a popular destination for an active vacation in the Italian Alps. You won’t need a car here, as the entire region is exemplary in its commitment to environmentally friendly transportation. The RittenCard gives you free use of all local transport, including the historic mountain railway and the cable car to Bolzano, as well as free entry to some 90 museums, exhibitions and attractions. “Thanks to our Green Mobility service, the car is a distant memory,” reports the ADLER Lodge RITTEN*. Here you also receive a RittenCard, as well as the possibility to rent e-bikes and hire experienced guides to accompany you on hikes or e-bike tours. Arrival: From the Bolzano train station it is a 5 minute walk to the Renon cable car. The cable car leaves every 4 minutes and takes you to Soprabolzano in 12 minutes. Once there, a shuttle from ADLER Lodge RITTEN will be waiting for you. The RittenCard is also included in the room price at the APIPURA hotel rinner and will be sent to you before you arrive. You can also reach the hotel from Bolzano with the Ritten cable car and from Oberbozen with the Ritten train – the “Rinner” stop is right in front of the hotel! If you are a bee lover, you will love the APIPURA hotel rinner: the hotel has its own organic apiary, there is a bee nature trail and organic honey is served daily at the breakfast buffet. Eco-friendly hiking vacation in the Hohe Tauern National Park with a guest card East Tyrol also has a guest card that allows you to use public transportation and offers free or a discount at many attractions. You receive one as a guest at the family-run Naturhotel Outside in Matrei. The hotel is an official hiking hotel with a hiking concierge and also offers a free shuttle from Lienz train station (there and back). A shuttle from Kitzbühel train station is available for a fee. Complimentary e-Shuttle service powered by green electricity If you travel by train, you are already traveling in a pretty environmentally friendly way. Now imagine being picked up at the station by an e-shuttle powered by the hotel’s green electricity – pretty green and convenient, isn’t it? This is possible at the Hotel Das Rübezahl in Füssen (the train station is also located here). And once you are there, the best way to explore the picturesque Allgäu region with its panoramic view of Neuschwanstein Castle is on foot. Hiking concierge Bergbaschdi will be happy to assist you. The Birkenhof***** Spa & Genussresort Hotel in the Upper Palatinate Lake District will pick you up at Schwandorf train station with its own electric shuttle. The hotel includes a large spa area with several saunas and pools, as well as the 2-star restaurant Obendorfers Eisvogel – you’ll find it hard to find a reason to leave the premises 🙂 At the Hotel Klosterbräu in Tyrol, you can order the hotel’s “Green Shuttle” (an electric Viano bus) for free throughout the Seefeld area. The Seefeld ICE train station is only 200 meters from the hotel, so you can easily walk there. However, the shuttle is worthwhile if you have heavy or bulky luggage, such as ski equipment or the like. The sustainable hotel complex within the old monastery walls offers a wide range of services, including wellness, its own brewery, yoga classes, a petting zoo and child care. “The electric vehicle is a highlight for our guests,” reports the CERVO Mountain Resort in Zermatt. As mentioned above, the village of Zermatt is car-free, and apart from the electric vehicles, only horse-drawn carriages are allowed. The CERVO consists of several wooden chalets and has an award-winning design style. Rail and Hotel: More eco-friendly hotels with shuttle services in Europe To stay within the scope of this article, we will give you a brief overview of even more sustainable European hotels with shuttle services: Germany Austria Italy Eco-hotels in Paris and Milan Of course, city hotels in European metropolises are ideal for combining train and eco-hotel. “Paris has 6 train stations, and depending on which direction guests are coming from, they arrive at the appropriate station. From Germany, it is Gare de L’Est and Gare du Nord,” says Barbara Tascijevic-Porwoll of the Green Spirit Hotels. The Amelie, Malar and Le Pavilion hotels are all in the 7th arrondissement, within walking distance of the Eiffel Tower. By the way, Paris has done a lot to become more bike-friendly and has created many new bike paths! Of course, there is also the famous metro, which is an environmentally friendly way to get from A to B. The marbled Milan Central Station is also accessible from all over Europe with direct lines. Here, in the heart of the city, lies the Hotel Milano Scala, Italy’s first zero-emissions hotel. All electricity is generated by geothermal probes. From the train station to the hotel by bus, bike, or on foot For our more rural partners, traveling by train is not quite as easy – but no less appealing for it. “We recommend that you take your bike with you when you arrive by train. And then cycle the rest of the way from Eystrup or Nienburg station to us,” explain the host sisters at Hotel Okelmann’s in Warpe. The train stations are about 20 kilometers away and can be reached from Bremen or Hannover. There is also a lot to discover in the area by bike. The Okelmanns’ father is an enthusiastic cyclist himself and has entered several routes in komoot. The Gut Guntrams in Austria can be reached from Vienna’s Pitten train station. From there, it is a 25-minute walk along a forest nature trail to Guntramsburg. The hotel’s website offers a beautifully designed map of the trail, complete with photos and arrows. First by train, then by bus The Pfunds in Tirol bus stop is just one minute from the Summit Lodges Pfunds, so you can catch the bus right outside your vacation home. The spacious log cabin has its own sauna and fireplace! During the winter there is also a ski bus to the ski area. The nearest train station is Landeck-Zams. To get to the Naturresort Gerbehof by train, you must first get to the train station in Friedrichshafen on Lake Constance. The station is 5 kilometers from the resort and there are buses to Ailingen every 15 minutes. The walk from Ailingen bus station to Gerbehof is 1.2 kilometers. A little exercise in nature never hurts anyone, as they say! Alternatively, you can always take a taxi from the station to your accommodation. Either way, you are traveling in a climate-friendly way and keeping your carbon footprint small. Both by traveling and by choosing your accommodation. You may even find that you enjoy traveling by public transportation or bicycle and use them more at home. *CIN-Codes: IT021011A1AE4737IT (My Arbor), IT008010A1NIWKHTTF (Relais del Maro), IT021072A1L46PNBHX (Hotel Weihrerhof), IT021072A1UOWUIDH4 (APIPURA hotel rinner), IT021072A1QCJQTLUQ (ADLER Lodge RITTEN) Save the article for your next travel plans and arrival by train."
Green Wedding: special places for a special day,"Some people want peace and quiet, while others crave action while on vacation – How do you balance that in a relationship? Not at all? Relationship therapist Dr. Ursina Brun del Re suggests in the NZZ that some couples are better off traveling separately. But there are also (sustainable) lodges where your couple vacation will be in good hands, despite your different interests. In the beginning: “We are a package deal” When a relationship is new, couples often do everything together while on vacation. Many think that’s the way it has to be. Or they’re so in love that it doesn’t even occur to them to do anything separately. The romantic hotel Das Rübezahl in Füssen in the Allgäu can confirm this. “We specialize in couples,” the host family tells us, adding: “As a rule, all couples do everything together.” On our last visit, we learned that a marriage proposal happens almost every week! It’s no wonder that most of the couples there are practically inseparable. Traveling with different preferences This changes over time. At least for some couples I know (and I have been married for 16 years now). You get to know each other better, accept different preferences and views, trust each other more, and maybe are just a little bit more honest. You may have started out watching the Olympics together, but four years later you admit that you’re not really interested in that and would rather do something else. It can be the same with vacations. The important thing is that you don’t see it as a problem, but as an opportunity for each part of the relationship to maintain its own character. A partnership is about giving and receiving In a partnership, there is time to spend together, time when one person does something just for the other, and time for oneself. Children, work, and other people come into the relationship, and successful couples come to terms and find their way. In everyday life and on vacation. (Not that I’m always that successful, but I’m just saying that in general 😉 ) These Green PearlsⓇ accommodations frequently host pairs with different interests #1 Hotel Weihrerhof, South Tyrol – He can go hiking, she takes a sunbath on the lake “We often have couples with different interests at the hotel,” says Klaus Pichler of Hotel Weihrerhof in South Tyrol. The family-run boutique hotel is located 1,200 meters above sea level on the shores of Lake Wolfsgruben, amidst the mountain panorama of the Ritten. “ The man is usually the more active and goes hiking, biking, etc. The wife enjoys the stay at the Weihrerhof with short walks along the lake, on the sunbathing lawn or in the SeaSpa with unique treatments.” – Hotel Weihrerhof #2 My Arbor near Bressanone/Brixen in South Tyrol – Individual time management „From wellness and outdoor adventures to sports and relaxation, we offer a wide range of options to meet a variety of needs.“ – My Arbor My Arbor is a luxurious adults-only hotel nestled in the treetops with fantastic views of the Dolomites. Each week there is a varied program of guided hikes (skiing in winter), spa treatments, forest bathing, etc. to choose from. To see what such a program might look like, click here. #3 Hotel Bella Vista Zermatt – Couples have a lot to talk about in the evening Hotel Bella Vista is “definitely ideal” for couples with different preferences, says host Fabienne Anthamatten. Her family’s hotel in car-free Zermatt has a beautiful terrace with a fantastic view of the Swiss icon, the Matterhorn. Couples sit here in the evenings (or in the cozy lobby by the fire in winter) and talk about their day. One of them has usually been on an outdoor adventure which starts right outside the front door, while the other has been relaxing in the adults-only spa or exploring Zermatt. #4 CERVO Moutain Resort Zermatt – A resort with a lot of possibilities Also in Zermatt is the CERVO Mountain Resort, which consists of several wooden buildings. There are three restaurants, a spa area, a gym, a climbing wall… and the Alps, glaciers and Zermatt village shops are just outside the door. „One person can ski during the day and the other can spend a day at the spa. In the evening, you can have dinner or après-ski together.“ – CERVO Mountain Resort #5 Summit Lodges Pfunds, Tyrol – One goes skiing, the other goes snowshoeing Interestingly, at the Summit Lodges Pfunds vacation houses, it is also very common for couples to plan their excursion program separately, says owner Marco Spiss. Pfunds is a quiet and traditional community in Tyrol, perfect for a nature vacation with all the freedom you need. “ It is often the case that one partner is on the slopes (Serfaus, Ischgl, Nauders) and the other prefers snowshoeing or simply walking on the many hiking trails in the area (especially the Tschey in Pfunds)” – Marco Spiss, Summit Lodges Pfunds But the sustainable accommodation also offers plenty of opportunities for togetherness, such as a private sauna and an open fireplace that is stocked with firewood when you arrive. #6 Hotel Klosterbräu, Tirol – Two activity guides to choose from If you prefer to stay in a hotel in Tyrol, the Hotel Klosterbräu in Seefeld is a good choice in the region. “[Holidays with different interests] are definitely possible with us, as our two activity guides Clemens and Thomas plan on different levels. This means that if the woman (or man) wants to climb a via ferrata and the man (or woman) prefers a morning walk, there is something for everyone.” – Hotel Klosterbräu The hotel is also ideal if you want to take your children with you. There is the hotel’s own petting zoo “Siggis Sauhaufen” and child care nearby. There is also a large spa area – something for everyone. #7 Biohotel Grafenast, Tyrol – Nature vacation – also with children The Biohotel Grafenast in Pill is another hotel where you can enjoy a great vacation together as a couple or with your children and where there are different options for everyone. It is located high above the Tyrolean Inn Valley and has a fantastic view of the valley. Some of the 23 rooms are equipped as family rooms and depending on the season there is a special program for the children. „We are a great place to combine different interests“ – Biohotel Grafenast #8 Naturhotel Outside, East Tyrol – Combined vacation in the Alpine National Park Our Green Pearls® partner, the Naturhotel Outside in the Hohe Tauern National Park in East Tyrol, suggests several possible “combos” for you: #9 Hotel Luise, Erlangen – Sustainable city vacation in Bavaria For a sustainable vacation in Germany, there are also some sustainable hotels where you are in good hands as joint individual travelers. For example, the Hotel Luise in Erlangen: “ Erlangen is ideally located for travelers with a variety of interests. You can take a city vacation or head out into nature – no matter which adventure you choose, you can relax in our spa after an exciting day.” – Hotel Luise City vacation: The hotel is centrally located in Erlangen and Nuremberg, Fürth, Bamberg, Lauf a. d. Pegnitz are nearby and easily accessible by train. Culture: Erlangen has a lot to offer culture lovers. The ComicSalon Erlangen takes place every two years and the Poet*innen Fest takes place every year. Nuremberg offers the Imperial Castle, the German Museum and other cultural highlights. Nature: If you prefer to be outdoors, explore Franconian Switzerland (where you can climb, swim, hike, bike, explore caves, and more) – you can even bike right from the hotel to the Tennenloher Forest Nature Reserve. There are wild horses, goats, sand dunes, moors and more to discover. Find out more about how to spend your time in Erlangen in our blog article: “Insider tips for a sustainable weekend in Erlangen” #10 Birkenhof***** Spa & Wellness, Upper Palatinate – Enjoy sustainable luxury Looking for something more luxurious? Then there is a truly exceptional gourmet hotel for sports, wellness and culinary enthusiasts on a hill in the Opferpfälzer Seenland. The 5-star Hotel Birkenhof is committed to renewable energy and e-mobility at the highest level. Speaking of high standards: It is also home to the 2-star restaurant Obendorfers Eisvogel”. “We are very good at catering to different interests. We have a wellness and relaxation offer and we are a hotel in the middle of nature with hiking possibilities, water skiing in the lake area, golf and cycling.” – Lukas Obendorfer, Birkenhof***** Spa & Genussresort #11 Klosterhof – Alpine Hideaway & Spa, Berchtesgadener Land – For couples who not only want different activities, but also different menus At Hotel Klosterhof – Alpine Hideway & Spa, couples often order different meals, according to the host family. A popular variation is when one person is vegan and the other is not. In this case, there is an all vegetable “Kraut und Rüben” menu every evening. There are often babymoon guests at the health hotel. Here the pregnant woman can participate in a special program while the father-to-be can do other things. In the evening you can enjoy the famous Barbarossa Mocktails together – each to your own taste. #12 Naturresort Gerbehof, Lake Constance Region – Sporty nature vacation Naturresort Gerbehof is the perfect place for you if you want to be surrounded by a natural, organic atmosphere. The sustainable hotel is located amidst the famous orchards of the Lake Constance region and is especially beautiful during the blossoming and apple harvest season. “ We have opportunities for wellness, hiking, biking, sailing and surfing.” – Naturresort Gerbehof #13 Lifestylehotel SAND – Vacation at the Baltic Sea “ We are currently experiencing a huge increase in demand for offers for couples,” says Marion Muller, hostess of the Lifestylehotel SAND in Timmendorfer Strand. We described what such a weekend for two could look like in our blog article Baltic Sea for two. The Adults Only Hotel offers several specials for couples. It is not necessary to do everything together with your partner. In this case, the hostess recommends the combination of the two offers “SANDromance” and “SANDstarnight”. This means ” Feel Good” for one and ” Outdoor Experience ” for the other. #14 STURM in Mellrichstadt – Adventure and relaxation At the sustainable Hotel STURM in Mellrichstadt in the Biosphere Reserve Rhön, most couples with different interests combine “adventure” and “relaxation”. Each partner can plan their day as they wish – one can go on an adventure tour and explore the surrounding forests, moors and caves, while the other relaxes with sauna sessions and massages. „Perfect balance: each partner organizes the day according to his or her own wishes. End the day together with a delicious organic menu in the restaurant, followed by a drink in the lounge or in front of the fireplace.“ – STURM Holidays for couples with different interests in Thailand, Italy, France and Nepal #15 Keemala Villas Wonderland on Phuket – Everyone is allowed dream Our Green PearlsⓇ partner, Keemala, on the Thai island of Phuket, has just been named “Best Resort in Thailand” and “One of the Best Hotels in the World” by the One Step 4Ward blog – after travel blogger Johnny Ward spent 18 years traveling the world. He was there with his wife and they did everything together (yes, he just got married in 2021 – so it’s still fresh :-)). They even had their booked spa treatments moved to the same room. But you can also experience something on your own as a couple. “Keemala caters to the needs of couples with different interests with our wellness and outdoor adventure themes.” – Keemala Wellness: Spa treatments, yoga, wellness classes and mediation sessions Culinary delights: Indulge in nutritious and wellness-oriented cuisine Outdoor Adventure: Explore the rainforest and local wildlife on guided eco-tours. There are trails for all levels. Water activities: Kayaking and Snorkeling #16 Holidays at the Albergo Diffuso Relais del Maro in Liguria How about the idyllic setting of a Ligurian village for your vacation? Borgomaro, in the hinterland of the coastal city of Imperia, is home to the Relais del Maro – an Albergo Diffuso spread over several houses in the village. In the morning one person goes to the pool while the other sleeps in – later one person walks through the olive groves and tastes the famous Taggiasca olives while the other hires an e-bike from the reception to cycle along the coast. In the evening you will meet again for dinner and end your day with good food and good conversation. #17 Couple vacation at the Green Spirit Hotels in Paris If you are looking for an eco-friendly and personalized place to stay in Paris, we recommend Green Spirit Hotels: Le Pavillon, Hotel Malar and Hotel Amélie – all located in the lively 7th arrondissement and within walking distance of the Eiffel Tower, the Seine and other major attractions. Because the Green Spirit eco-hotels are very small, you can’t do many things separately in the hotels themselves, says host Barbara Tascijevic with a laugh. But in the city of Paris, this is a matter of course! #18 The Pavilions Himalaya – The Farm, Nepal – Safari and Yoga Last but not least, The Pavilions Himalayas – The Farm Hotel also told us that couples with different interests are very welcome. The sustainable resort in the foothills of the Himalayas runs its own organic farm, helps farmers convert to certified organic farming, and donates a full 70 percent of its income to the local Right4Children project. There are eco-tours to explore Nepal’s stunning nature, cultural temples and festivals, and safari tours. Alternatively, one of you could lounge by the pool at the resort or practice yoga with the local yoga guru. As you can see, there are many ways to combine different vacation desires in one place. That way, you can both get your money’s worth and still spend your vacation together. Of course, going separately is also an option, but our interests at home aren’t that far apart, at least 🙂 What are your experiences? Would you like to do something on your own on vacation? Or have you maybe already been doing it for a long time? We look forward to your comments. Save this article for your next vacation planning!"
"15 Tips for Sustainable Travel in 2024 – From travelers, sustainability professionals and tourism experts","You know what argument against sustainable travel is absolute nonsense? That traveling sustainably is always going to cost more. Yes, sustainable travel is sometimes more expensive, it requires us to do more research and work on ourselves. But spend more money? You don’t have to. In fact, you can actually save money by going sustainable! We’ll show you how! The most important rule for sustainable travel: Planning Yes, you read that right. If you’re traveling on a budget, or can’t or won’t go overspend, you need to plan and book a lot of things in advance. First and foremost, your transportation and accommodations. Sure, you can get lucky with last-minute bargains, but in most cases you will end up paying more elsewhere. For example: You book a dirt-cheap last-minute flight (never mind that flying is unsustainable!), but you have to pay a lot for your last-minute accommodations because there are hardly any options left, all the low-budget options are fully booked, or only the terrible accommodations are available. So remember: If you want to travel on a budget, book early! Spontaneous bookings are expensive! However, that doesn’t mean you have to plan your entire vacation in advance. It’s great to just go with the flow when you get there, talk to the locals, and then decide what you want to do! Tips for your budget When planning your low-budget trip, the first step is to determine your budget. How much can you spend? And how much do you want to spend? You should also be clear about what is important to you. For example, if a decent hotel is important to you, plan to spend a little more on that and a little less on activities that cost money. If certain (and expensive) experiences are more important to you, you may want to cut back on your accommodations. Either way, write your thoughts down! Believe us, it makes a difference to have your budget in black and white next to you as you plan, not just in your head! Low Budget and sustainable travel: Planning questions How would you like to travel? Planning a city trip? Want to enjoy a beach vacation? Go hiking? Experience nature? Think about what is important to you. Sustainable because: You think about your trip in advance and can make sustainable decisions from the start. For example, you don’t fly to Bali for a beach vacation because that’s what everyone else is doing, but you choose a vacation in Italy or Croatia. Where do I get what I want? Some destinations are cheaper than others because, for example, they are not yet overrun with tourists. Or because costs are generally lower than in your home country. Examples of such destinations are Albania, Croatia, or, if you want to go further afield, Vietnam Sustainable because: By traveling to less touristy areas instead of the popular hotspots, you help spread out the flow of people and counteract mass tourism. You also support the economy of a destination that would otherwise not benefit as much from travelers. When do I want to travel? Or even: Does it really have to be high season? Of course, if you are tied to vacation times or the like, you have little choice. But if you have a choice, it’s better to travel off-season. Accommodations and activities are often less expensive and it’s less crowded. In the low season, which follows the high season, almost everything is still open (restaurants, activities, etc.). The further away from the high season you travel, the cheaper the prices will be, but the more restaurants and other places may be closed. Sustainable because: Similar to choosing a destination, by traveling off-season, you not only help your wallet, but also spread out the tourist traffic over a longer period of time. In addition, you support the usually highly seasonal income of the owners and provide them with a more reliable income. Travel: Affordable and sustainable options How do I get to my destination? The journey is the reward” applies not only to slow travel, but also to planning a sustainable budget trip. Having this mindset is literally worth its weight in gold. If you treat your trip as part of your vacation, you will be more relaxed about the whole thing. Trust us 😉 So plan your trip, check out the trains (if you book early, they are usually not that expensive), or if you drive an (e-)car, plan to drive a little slower (saves fuel and CO2) and make a stopover for long trips. The cheapest option is often the long-distance bus. And since the network is constantly expanding, it has become a real alternative in recent years! According to recent surveys, it is also as environmentally friendly as the train. You can read more about this in our blog article about long-distance bus destinations in Europe. Sustainable because: Traveling by train and bus is the most environmentally friendly choice. Buses are usually the cheapest, but trains can also be quite inexpensive (if you book well in advance). However, we understand if you don’t want to (or can’t) rely on trains and prefer to travel by car. However, you can still apply the slow travel principle 😉 Where and how do I want to stay? We know where we want to go, when we want to travel, and how we want to get there. The only thing we don’t have is a place to stay. For travelers on a budget, there are many options, from couchsurfing, housesitting and wwoofing to hostels or hotels. It all depends on your personal preferences, expectations and time constraints. Since we know hotels best, we’ll focus on that. As always, the best time to book is early! Some hotels even offer discounts if you book early! Check out the deals and packages the hotels have available and ideally choose a room with a small kitchenette or opt for an apartment or house with a kitchen so you can cook for yourself. You can often get special rates for longer stays. When in doubt, it is always worth asking the hotel directly (and booking anyway). Sustainable accommodation for less than 100 euros Sustainable accommodations are available for almost every budget. Even in the heart of Paris, Green Spirit Hotels offer private rooms and organic breakfasts without breaking the bank. You can also find cozy, family-friendly accommodations at the APIPURA hotel rinner on the Ritten in South Tyrol, where rooms start at €89.00 (including half-board). Sustainable because: You know us: we firmly believe that choosing sustainable accommodations (along with how you get there) is at the heart of sustainable travel. Whether it’s budget, luxury or anything in between. What do I really want to experience? To avoid tourist traps, long lines, or worse, missing out on your personal must-do or must-see, we recommend thinking about it in advance and building it into your budget planning. You can often book time slots for attractions or museums in advance and even get online discounts! (Some museums and similar places now even require you to do this!) You can also check out tourist passes from home and see if they are worthwhile for you, and you can compare tour providers if you want to take a particular tour. Of course, this does not apply to everything, as there are bound to be a number of (local) operators who are not represented on the Internet. Keep this in mind and find a good balance between planning and booking in advance and being spontaneous when you get there. Sustainable because: Research the area around your destination in advance. This will help you learn when certain attractions are packed so you can avoid those times. You may also find an insider tip or two for local restaurants or tour operators that you would not have found otherwise, and you will generally get a feel for your destination. You’ll also be less likely to be tempted into unsustainable activities once you get there. After all, you have a plan – one that you can and should be flexible with 🙂 Sustainable travel “on a budget” is not complicated Budget travel in general, and sustainable budget travel in particular, requires a higher level of planning than if you were going on a spur-of-the-moment adventure. In most cases – don’t get us wrong! With all the planning, there is only one thing to remember: Have fun! Don’t just look at your budget once you get there; stay spontaneous and open to opportunities to experience your vacation spot or destination authentically. You can lay the groundwork for this with sustainable budget travel planning. Save this article for your next travel planning on Pinterest"
The 5 most beautiful eco-luxury hotels in the Alps,"Don’t you feel a strong connection to the universe when you look up at the starry sky? You realize that you are a small dot in a vast world. If so, you’re not alone. Booking.com predicts that one of the top vacation trends for 2025 will be nocturism. And since the best way to see the stars is without light pollution, nocturnal tourism is also linked to sustainability. You can learn more about this and find out which sustainable accommodations are ideal for star gazing here. PS: There will be three highlights in the sky in 2025. Tips for stargazing Get started without expensive equipment First of all, you don’t need expensive equipment to stargaze. A simple pair of binoculars will do. If you want to bring a flashlight, make sure it has a red light (hint: put a piece of red parchment paper in front of it). It takes about 30 minutes for the eye to fully adjust to the darkness. The red light makes the adjustment easier. Known constellations as help If you’re new to stargazing, it might help to compare it to exploring a new city. Large buildings and famous monuments help you find your way around. The same is true for stargazing: The brightest stars and familiar constellations are your landmarks. From there, you can more easily find other, smaller stars. Keep your phone out of it Of course, there are some apps that support your stargazing, but you should keep in mind that stargazing in the open field works better without a smartphone. For one thing, the display is actually much too small to be of any real help. Another reason also makes sense ( ;)): Your eyes don’t manage the change between display and darkness well. Observing the stars is thus made more difficult. So: READ inside. RESEARCH outside. You can get an overview with Star Charts There are many star maps available online that can help you get started. This can be done from your window. You can either follow the current state of the sky at the given hour, or you can do it yourself. Celestial events in 2025 There will be a series of breathtaking astronomical events in 2025. Some of the highlights according to KOSMOS Sky Year are Tip: If you want to help science while stargazing (on vacation or at home), you can participate in the Globe at Night project. For instance, you can report whether you were able to identify all the stars in Pegasus. What is light pollution? Stars are best seen in total darkness. That’s logical, you might think. However, total darkness is not so easy to find in our world, especially in Central Europe. So-called light pollution dominates. Our Earth is getting brighter by 9.6 percent every year. Of the trillions of stars in the universe, only 3,000 can be seen with the naked eye! We use so much light to illuminate our streets and buildings that we can’t see shooting stars or the Milky Way. Do you know about the light that shines over cities and populated areas? While the effects of light pollution on insects have been known for a long time, the impact of artificial light on marine life has only recently begun to be studied. “Darkness is a habitat,” – Mark Lenz, scientific coordinator of the international marine research project The fight against light pollution has inspired the International Dark Sky Association (IDA) to designate the Eifel National Park in North Rhine-Westphalia and tthe Westhavelland Nature Park in Brandenburg as Germany’s first star parks. In these particularly dark places, you can see the Milky Way perfectly at night. Nebulae and even more distant galaxies are also visible when there is little or no light pollution. Special places for stargazing The star parks also offer guided tours. Of course, you can view constellations and the Milky Way from just about anywhere, including from the Green Pearls® accommodations. And we asked them where the best places are to look for stars, how much or how little light pollution there is, and if there are any stargazing tours available. Alone without light pollution The Klosterhof Alpine Hideaway & Spa in Upper Bavaria is located on a plateau in Bayerisch Gmain, which is (almost) alone in its location and where air pollution is significantly reduced. Every Friday, a Late Spa Night “Sole, Moon & Stars” is offered until 10 pm. Relax in the Jacuzzi and let your eyes wander. The highlights are the monthly ‘full moon’ concerts. You may be lucky enough to experience these celebrations outside on the terrace, giving you the opportunity to watch the (full) moon while listening to music. Become a stargazer in the light protection area STURM’s location also provides the perfect environment for avid stargazers. The Rhön has been declared a light protection area. Due to the low light pollution you can discover stars, the Milky Way and even planets. There are designated areas with wooden sofas for stargazing. In addition, there are regular events about the stars, such as the star park weeks in August. Sternpark Rhön e.V. offers public and private guided tours to learn more about the stars throughout the year. The site also offers free star maps to help you identify the stars in the sky. Sleep outside and never miss a shooting star But you can enjoy your new hobby not only on special tours. The Lifestylehotel SAND offers a very special experience. The SAND Sleeping Basket is available year-round and is perfect for a night under the stars. You can fall asleep and wake up with a view of the stars, the hinterland and the Baltic Sea from the hotel’s roof terrace. Viewpoint as an observatory If you’re looking for another perfect place for stargazing, you’ll find it very close to Hotel Luise. You can see a clear starry sky from a hill near Marloffstein, which is near Marloffstein in the district of Erlangen-Höchstadt. You also have a clear view of the sky from the hotel’s roof terrace. But at Hotel Luise, you don’t even have to leave the building, let alone your bed, to see the stars. In some of the double rooms, you can enjoy hand-painted starry skies that glow in the dark =) The sky full of stars The Naturhotel Outside in East Tyrol also presents itself as the perfect place for stargazers. It is idyllically located in the Hohe Tauern National Park. Because pollution is low in the mountains, stargazing is a natural activity under cloudless skies – even from the heated outdoor pool 😉 Night walks in the moonlight Would you like to walk in the moonlight and discover stars and constellations? The location of the Hotel SCHWARZWALD PANORAMA in the spa town of Bad Herrenalb is ideal for stargazing. Since there are no big cities nearby. In Bad Herrenalb, there are also frequent guided tours or night walks on this theme. If you are on vacation with the whole family or with friends, you can book a night watchman tour with night watchman Bernhard Lohner for 85 euros (all-inclusive price for a group of 2 to 25 people). In dark corners he will tell you many things about the night and a forgotten time… Noctourism helps to reduce light pollution As the aforementioned Booking.com study on travel trends for 2025 found, sustainability is important to many travellers. The surprising new trend of noctourism supports this: ‘A majority of travellers (54%) would book accommodation without lighting in order to reduce light pollution and protect flora and fauna.’ – Booking.com survey According to the scientists around Mark Lenz, the switch to LED – which makes light cheaper – has led to more light being used. If you visit dark sky parks and light-protected areas as a tourist, you support these dark habitats. Furthermore, you can also make sure not to unnecessarily brighten up your surroundings with non-stop garden lighting, etc."
The 5 most beautiful eco-luxury hotels in the Alps,"Clean beaches and seas, unspoiled nature in the mountains – that’s what tourists want. And hotels want to deliver. The problem is that the hotel industry itself is a major source of plastic waste. Single-use plastics in the form of typical hotel slippers, small packages in the bathroom and at the buffet, along with straws and cups, add up to mountains of plastic in conventional hotels. We took a look at sustainable Green PearlsⓇ hotels, what alternatives are available and how to avoid single-use plastics in general. The problem with disposables in hotels When you stay at a hotel, you get everything you need: your luggage is taken care of, a refreshing drink is waiting for you in your room, a variety of toiletries are available in the bathroom, towels and slippers are provided… and while you are lying by the pool or sitting in the restaurant, your room is cleaned, the bed is made and all opened tubes and packages are replaced with new ones. Sound great? For sustainability-minded travelers like you, probably not. Because: All of this (among other things) creates a lot of waste. Hotels and vacation rentals definitely have a single-use problem, and it has to do with the following:: Expensive hotels produce less waste than cheap ones According to the DEHOGA environmental brochure, 0 to 2-star hotels produce 9.1 liters of waste per guest per day, 4-star hotels 3.4 liters (5-star hotels produce slightly more at 3.7 liters). According to the German Hotel and Restaurant Association (DEHOGA), this is mainly due to disposable packaging in the lower star categories. In the upscale hotel industry, less disposable packaging is used simply for style’s sake – e.g. cloth napkins instead of paper napkins, ceramic or stainless steel milk jugs instead of plastic condensed milk containers, etc. But simply choosing a higher star rating is not enough to eliminate waste and single-use packaging. Especially since not everyone can or wants to. Above all, it takes hoteliers who really care and are committed to reducing waste in their properties. Zero waste or at least “less waste” is a central concern for Green Pearls® accommodations. Each accommodation has its own approach to waste reduction, which you can read about on the Green Pearls® pages and on their individual websites. As mentioned above, many of them are Zero Waste representatives, striving for a low environmental footprint and a circular economy in all areas. We believe that Green PearlsⓇ hotels are among the lowest waste producers in the industry. “In terms of waste and plastic reduction, sustainably certified hotels are generally more advanced than non-certified hotels.” – WWF WWF study on single-use and reusable products in the hospitality industry In 2019 and 2024, WWF Germany investigated the issue of single-use plastics in the hotel industry. For the 2019 study, WWF surveyed hotels and hotel guests in Italy, France, Greece and Spain. In 2024, the data was supplemented by expert interviews and a literature review. It found that the majority of guests use significantly more reusable packaging at home than on vacation. Hoteliers are determined to act, but face many obstacles: For every 50 million disposables, only half a million reusables are sold “In 2022, the share of reusable packaging (by number of items) in the hotel industry was only 1.2 percent. (600,000 items compared to 50.6 million disposable items) and consisted almost entirely of beverage containers.” – Untersuchung der Gesellschaft für Verpackungsmarktforschung mbH (GVM) für den WWF All too often, “habit” is to blame for not using reusable products. By the way, the WWF believes that reusable products make much more sense than disposable products made from “eco-materials”. In other words, a refillable plastic bottle is better than a disposable bamboo cup. Washable cloth napkins are better than disposable napkins made from recycled cellulose. This is how sustainable hotels avoid disposable packaging Amenities upon request Many sustainable hotels and resorts have started to remove amenities such as toothbrushes, razors, sewing kits, etc. from the rooms and store them at the front desk. That way, you still get them, but only if you really need and ask for them. “By providing standard amenities only upon request, we avoid unnecessary use,” says Farmhouse Smiling Gecko in Cambodia. The resort also offers many homemade products from the resort’s own workshops, which Smiling Gecko uses to support the local community. When it comes to the amenities that are still offered on request, sustainable accommodation also ensures that they are produced sustainably and fairly. This is what the Naturresort Gerbehof in Friedrichshafen on Lake Constance reports. Honesty bar with reusable glasses instead of a minibar The minibar is another element that must be provided to meet hotel standards. In addition to energy consumption, drinks and snacks in disposable packaging also have a negative impact on the environment. Gut Guntrams near Vienna therefore installed a “central minibar” in the form of a Honesty Bar and left the individual minibars in the rooms empty. The Honesty Bar offers homemade sweet and savory treats in reusable glass jars. Homemade welcome cookies A small welcome gift for guests is a nice touch. But as Zero Waste advocate Béá Johnson says, promotional gifts and giveaways are often a source of waste. Not so at the Hotel Bella Vista Zermatt in Switzerland. There, homemade cookies on a plate greet guests in the mountains near the Matterhorn. A water bottle for the duration of your stay Many hotels provide their guests with a refillable water bottle. At the OCÉANO Health Spa Hotel on Tenerife, the “OCÉANO Glass Bottle” is available and there are water dispensers throughout the hotel where you can refill the bottle with fresh, filtered water. This fits in with the wide range of sports and wellness activities on offer and also saves a lot of bottles and miles of transportation 🙂 Source of waste: breakfast buffet? Zero waste is also an option! One of the biggest contributors to packaging and food waste in the hotel industry is the breakfast buffet. All Green Pearls® hotels have optimized this aspect. “There are no packaged products at our breakfast buffet,” reports the APIPURA hotel rinner on the ritten in South Tyrol. Instead, the child-friendly hotel offers organic products in small jars – one of the highlights are the various types of organic honey from the hotel’s own beekeeping. Zero waste measures at the breakfast buffet: Elimination of disposable hygiene products Disposable bathroom hygiene products are the second major area where mountains of plastic waste accumulate in conventional hotels. This refers to the small packages of shampoo, shower gel, soap, body lotion, shower cap, toothbrush, razor and so on. Sustainable hotels show that these products can be provided to guests in a stylish and hygienic way and do not have to be the norm. Solid Soap and Shampoo At the Klosterhof Alpine Hideaway & Spa in Berchtesgadener Land, Bavaria, the bathroom features soap and shampoo bars, as well as refillable shower gel dispensers as an alternative to traditional bottles. You can do the same at home, by the way! Dispenser Speaking of dispensers: Another option you might want to consider for the home are refillable, larger, and often more attractive dispensers for soap, shampoo, conditioner, shower gel, and the like. According to soap manufacturer MarcelsGreenSoap, a refill bag saves 85% of plastic packaging! Almost all Green Pearls® accommodations now use dispensers – with natural ingredients. “Our shampoos and shower gels (in the dispensers) are from Tiroler Kräuterhof, so they are 100% natural and regional,” reports Summit Lodges Pfunds. Biohotel Grafenast in Tyrol even offers dispensers with arnica muscle gel for relaxation after long hikes around the Pillberg 😉 Natural cosmetics free of chemicals and microplastics For our Green PearlsⓇ partners, the use of environmentally friendly cosmetic products is very important. At Pavilions Himalayas – The Farm in Nepal, you can buy bamboo toothbrushes with hemp bristles and plastic-free toothpaste tabs made according to Ayurvedic principles, as are the other personal care products. Avoiding chemicals and microplastics is particularly important to them to protect the water quality of their organic farm.. The Green Spirit hotels in Paris (Hotel Malar, Hotel Amelie and Hotel Le Pavillon, all in the central 7th arrondissement within walking distance of the Eiffel Tower) use soaps, shampoos and shower gels from Austrian natural cosmetics company Pure Green. The luxurious Klosterbräu wellness hotel in Seefeld, Tyrol, spoils its guests with premium products from Augustinus Bader – some of which have been developed exclusively for the hotel. The Lifestylehotel SAND in Timmendorfer Strand on the Baltic Sea has embraced ‘Björk&Berries‘. Nordic, sustainable, refillable and stylish,” they say. Food from their own harvest In the hotel industry, buying food in bulk is one way to reduce unnecessary packaging. Where possible, regionally. “We work almost exclusively with local suppliers to avoid long transport routes and support the regional economy,” says My Arbor near Brixen in South Tyrol. However, food packaging is avoided in particular through direct in-house production. “From cakes to chocolates to syrups, we make everything ourselves,” explains the adults-only wellness hotel. “All our fresh fruit and vegetables come from our own farm in Albisano on Lake Garda. The owner, Mr Huber, personally takes care of the harvest and brings the produce directly to the hotel (without packaging waste) so that our guests can enjoy the freshest ingredients.” – My Arbor Dishes and glasses Disposable plastic cups at hotels? They do exist! Some hoteliers find them more convenient and less risky than glass or porcelain, especially for the lawn or pool. Unfortunately, they create a huge amount of waste. Sustainable hotels are careful to use only high-quality, plastic-free materials. The energy-independent aparthotel OLM Nature Escape in Sand in Taufers, South Tyrol, uses only glass, porcelain, ceramic, clay and enamel for food and drink. Tablecloths and napkins Just as glass and porcelain are more stylish than plastic tableware, cloth napkins are more sophisticated than paper napkins. You can find them, for example, at the Relais del Maro in Liguria. The Albergo Diffuso in the picturesque village of Borgomaro takes care to avoid waste in all areas. Consequently, linen tablecloths are washed rather than thrown away. Towel change upon request only Since laundry does not produce waste, but does use detergent, water and energy, daily hotel laundry is another factor that you, as a guest, can help with. Many guests notice that even towels that have been hung up are all replaced the next day. This calls for well-trained staff who, like at the Lifestyle Resort Zum Kurfürsten on the Mosel, change towels only when requested. Even in the large wellness area with sauna and several pools, guests are asked to use sauna towels sparingly and sometimes several times. Forgoing daily room cleaning and turn-down service Similarly, as a guest, you can support a hotel’s sustainability efforts by choosing not to have your room cleaned daily. In most cases, you have to explicitly decline. For example, the sustainable Hotel Luise in Erlangen, Germany, tried to switch to opt-in (i.e., you get daily room cleaning only if you want it), but that would have meant being stripped of all their hotel stars by the Hotel Stars Union! However, at the ADLER Lodge RITTEN in South Tyrol (a luxurious all-inclusive resort close to nature), the turndown service has become an opt-in offer. This means that rooms are only prepared in the evening if you, the guest, specifically request it. No slippers The slippers provided in a hotel’s spa area are disposable products that generate huge amounts of waste. According to the German magazine Focus, the Steigenberger Hotels alone (a total of 60 hotels and resorts) would order 180,000 pairs of slippers for their guests each year. One can only imagine the mountain of slipper waste in the entire industry! The HUBERTUS Mountain Refugio Allgäu has therefore removed the slippers from the rooms and will only provide them upon request. Instead, guests are asked to bring their own. The romantic Hotel Das Rübezahl in Füssen, Germany, takes a similar approach to the slipper issue: guests are only provided with hotel slippers for the spa upon request, and the slippers are made of linen and cork, making them compostable. Backpack and shopping bag provided In many vacation destinations, plastic bags are still the norm. Even though a lot of plastic waste could be avoided! That is why CERVO Mountain Resort Zermatt in Switzerland provides guests with both a backpack for hiking and reusable bags for shopping. Digital Guest Magazine Digitization also reduces waste. Guests receive a digital reservation confirmation, there is a digital guest magazine and digital services. At the Eco-Hotel Okelmann’s, for example, you can download Komoot maps created by Senior Okelmann to your phone so you can start cycling right away. The Hotel Klosterbräu in Seefeld, Tyrol, has a guest channel on the hotel TV where you can find out about all the events and offers at the hotel. Offering waste separation for guests As mentioned at the beginning, many people use more disposable items on vacation than at home. Recycling is also often not as successful on vacation. However, this is not always the guests’ fault… You may have experienced the situation where there is only one disposable waste bin in the hotel room and you don’t even have the opportunity to separate your own waste. Some hotels may also think that their international guests don’t know how to it. Not so at Keemala on the island of Phuket in Thailand. “We have clearly marked recycling and waste stations throughout the resort, making it easy for guests to dispose of their waste properly,” they wrote to us. Unlike many internationally managed hotels on the island of Phuket, Keemala is owned by a local family who are very conscious of their impact on the environment. The 5-star ADLER Lodge RITTEN is another example of how in-room waste separation can be done in style. Toilet paper made out of Tetra Pak According to Statista, global per capita consumption of toilet paper reach almost 14 kilograms per person in 2023. However, in Germany, the figure is much higher, at 30.6 kilograms per person. A lot of trees have to be cut down to produce all this fresh fiber. The SCHWARZWALD PANORAMA in Bad Herrenalb has switched to toilet paper made from recycled beverage cartons. This reflects the concept of recycling that the wellness and selfness hotel also applies to its room furnishings. Wooden coffee pods eliminate single-use plastics Coffee capsule machines are definitely not the most sustainable way to make coffee. However, they are a great solution for allowing guests in a hotel suite to make their own coffee. The Birkenhof***** Spa and Genuss Resort uses Rezemo wooden coffee capsules. They contain coffee from sustainable sources. The other amenities of the 5-star wellness hotel are packaged in plastic-free cardboard as well. Zero-Waste Goodbye Gift When you leave, hotels often give you a small parting gift – and that too is a source of packaging waste. Of course, sustainable hotels have also thought about how to give you, the guest, a gift that is both beautiful and environmentally friendly. At the Naturhotel Outside in the Hohe Tauern National Park in East Tyrol, Austria, guests receive a jar of homemade jam in a reusable glass jar. The Hotel Weihrerhof in South Tyrol, on the Italian side of the Alps, offers soaps from its own organic cosmetics line, BergSea, which uses water from the Wolfsgruben Lake, located directly in front of the hotel. “We want our guests to take the soaps home with them and continue to dream of the Weihrerhof,” says the host family. As you can see, Green PearlsⓇ hotels have put a lot of thought into how they can eliminate single-use items, waste and plastic, which means you may use no more single-use items on your vacation than you would at home – in fact, you may use fewer items than at home!"

"Hiking in Germany, Austria and Switzerland","Glittering snow, the sight of snow-capped mountains, and the anticipation of the next run… Do these images come to mind when you think of a winter vacation? Then you feel the same way we do. But that means you probably also face the same challenge we do: Can you enjoy a ski vacation with a clear conscience in the face of the climate and energy crisis? And what do sustainable skiing holidays even look like? Winter Tourism and its Environmental Impact Every year, millions of winter sports enthusiasts travel to ski resorts around the world. In Europe, the Alps are the destination of choice. Of course, the same is true for hikers and bikers in spring, summer, and fall. However, skiing in particular is not without environmental consequences. At peak times, such as New Year’s Eve and the winter holidays, too many people descend on the valleys, the preparation of the slopes has a massive impact on the natural ecosystem, and off-piste skiing and night skiing disturb wildlife. Then there are the effects of man-made climate change. Warmer winters with less snow are causing problems, especially for low-lying resorts. Artificial Snow for Profit Snow cannons are often used to maintain the economic viability of ski resorts that depend on winter tourism. However, they have a serious impact on the environment. For one, they require a lot of water to produce artificial snow (which is often lacking in the surrounding natural environment): more than 4,700,000 liters per hectare can easily accumulate in a single season. In addition, artificial snow systems consume a lot of energy – the equivalent of 130,000 four-person households per year. On top of that, artificial snow has a different chemical composition than natural snow. It is less permeable to air, more compact, and less thermally insulating, which puts a strain on the soil and vegetation. The additional meltwater in spring is another problem. Sustainability and Skiing: Can they go Hand in Hand? After our brief summary, which really only shows a tiny part of the environmental impact of ski tourism, you may be wondering if a ski vacation can be sustainable at all. The short answer is no. You (we!) cannot have a fully sustainable ski vacation. Or any kind of travel for that matter. But what we can do is minimize the negative impacts and increase the positive ones. Because not everything about ski tourism is bad. Many regions are dependent on (ski) tourism. And even though most tourist regions in the Alps and in the mountains, in general, are trying harder to make the other seasons attractive for vacationers, winter tourism remains an important pillar on which livelihoods are built. We will now show you what eco-conscious skiing could look like, what you need to consider when planning and preparing your vacation, and which Green Pearls® partners offer the right accommodations. 7 Tips for a More Sustainable Ski Vacation 1. Avoid mass tourism and travel during low season. If you are not tied to school vacations, you can book your ski vacation off-season. Not only will you save a few dollars, but you will not be sharing the snowy mountains with as many people as you would during peak season. That’s not only better for your nerves, it’s also better for the environment. When many people crowd into (remote) resorts, it puts a lot of pressure on those areas. This is known as “overtourism“, which has particularly serious consequences for the fragile ecosystems of the Alps. 2. Make your journey eco-friendly. Getting to your winter vacation is easy by train. Many Green Pearls® partners have good public transport connections. If you’re driving, for example, because you don’t want to lug your equipment through the train, choose ski resorts that are close to you or as close as possible. For instance, Balderschwang in the Allgäu is among the most snow-sure regions in Germany, with up to twelve meters of snow per season. 3. Buy and maintain your ski equipment sustainably. You can and should consider sustainability when purchasing your equipment. If you only ski once a season or are not sure if you want to continue the hobby, simply rent the equipment locally. Or, if you prefer, at a sporting goods store near where you live. If you want to own your own equipment, check out the ski sales in your area. They usually take place in late fall and you can buy well-maintained, often one-season equipment for a fraction of the original price. If you ski a lot and want to buy new equipment, choose sustainable companies. Examples include Atomic, Vaude, and Stöckli. If you then have your skis and board waxed with environmentally friendly, petroleum-free wax, you can make another small contribution to protecting the environment. 4. Local transportation Once you arrive at your resort, you can usually just leave your car for the rest of your stay. Many resorts have ski buses that leave your accommodation and take you to the valley stations of the resorts. Or perhaps the first slopes and trails start right outside the hotel, as is the case at the Paradiso Pure.Living Vegan Hotel on the Seiser Alm, the HUBERTUS Mountain Refugio in Balderschwang in the Allgäu region, or at the Hotel Bella Vista in Zermatt, Switzerland. It’s best to check the local and logistical conditions in advance. 5. Protect plants and animals For some skiers, there is nothing more exciting than skiing on fresh snow. But it is not great for nature. To avoid endangering wildlife and protect plants, it is important to stay on groomed slopes, trails, and paths. In the long run, all winter sports enthusiasts will benefit more if these marked boundaries are respected. This also applies to hiking and other activities in the mountains. Winter or summer. 6. Book a sustainable accommodation If you want to be sure that your accommodation is doing all it can to make your vacation as sustainable and environmentally friendly as possible, then book with one of our Green Pearls® partners. They do their best every day to conserve resources, strengthen the region, and keep their environmental footprint as small as possible. This way you can enjoy your winter vacation without a guilty conscience. In addition to the hotels mentioned above, we highly recommend The Peak in Sölden and Summit Lodges Pfunds in the Tyrolean Oberland. At both, you can take off your slippers, put on your ski boots, and hit the slopes. 7. Choose sustainable ski destinations When choosing a ski resort, try to find one that uses little or no artificial snow. The use of renewable energy and monitoring visitor numbers to prevent overcrowding on the mountain are also part of a sustainable resort. In South Tyrol, for example, almost all resorts have invested in renewable energy generation from the sun and water to power the facilities. Ski trails are designed to minimize the impact on nature, and free ski buses connect towns and resorts. The climate-friendly resort of Carezza has even pledged to become carbon neutral by 2025. It already has intelligent control of its snow cannons, and the water it uses to make artificial snow comes from its own reservoirs, not the environment. If you are unsure about how the resort of your choice is addressing these issues, you can always check in advance with the local tourist office or lift operators. In the Alps, for example, 19 destinations have joined forces under the banner of “Alpine Pearls” to promote environmentally friendly tourism.  The destinations under the umbrella of this association focus on soft mobility in their diverse mobility offers. As a guest, you can travel through the region in an environmentally friendly way thanks to innovative and climate-friendly travel offers. The avoidance of artificially groomed slopes, the use of renewable energies, and the monitoring of visitor numbers in the mountains are further important and conscious measures taken by Alpine Pearls towards sustainable ski tourism. A more Sustainable Ski Vacation? It can be done! Even if we can never have a 100% sustainable ski vacation, we hope these tips have shown you that we can at least travel more sustainably. And it doesn’t take much effort, does it? As a winter sports enthusiast, how do you sustainably practice your beloved snow hobby? Do you take responsibility for the climate and our planet?

Vegan inspiration: summer rolls from Keemala Resort,"Whether you’re already ‘teetotal’ or just ‘sober curious’. Non-alcoholic cocktails are all the rage. And they’re no longer called “mocktails”-because they don’t “mock” anything, they stand on their own. These tastefully mixed drinks invite you to enjoy them in a pleasant atmosphere. At the Klosterhof – Alpine Hideaway & Spa, bartender Angie creates a special non-alcoholic cocktail: the Winterdream. And we are allowed to share the recipe with you. Sober Sipping Revolution The ‘Sober Sipping Revolution’ highlights the growing popularity of non-alcoholic drinks and cocktails. As we mentioned in our article on mocktails (a term still in use in early 2023), bartenders are now creating entirely new drinks specifically to be non-alcoholic, rather than simply substituting alcohol with similar products in classic recipes.

Christmas trees with a good conscience – is that possible at all?,"This is an update from our sustainable-home-article from November 30, 2017 Can’t it be more sustainable? A question many of our Green PearlsⓇ partners ask themselves all the time. As a result, hotels and resorts have implemented a variety of measures to reduce electricity, water and heating costs, as well as waste and CO₂ emissions. Many of these measures can also be implemented at home! The beauty is that it often only takes one step to live greener for many years to come. Going green – Planning and implementation Living sustainably involves so many things… Do you sometimes feel like you are inconsistent, getting bogged down, and maybe paying too much attention to the wrong things? You’re not alone! And rest assured, it’s almost impossible to be perfect in all aspects. But from time to time, it’s worth taking a look at your own behavior and identifying where you can improve. To that end, let’s take a look at a few areas of the home to see what improvements can be made and which ones will have the biggest impact. 10 tips for a more sustainable home #1: Power supply Before we look at the biggest power consumers in your home, you can start by looking at the sources from which you draw electricity. One of the easiest tips: Switch to green power! Switching to a new power provider is easy – particularly since it’s part of the provider’s service to help you do so. When making the switch, make sure it is truly green electricity, 100% renewable and not nuclear or coal-fired. You can find comparisons of green power providers in your area on the internet. You will also find the electricity tariffs there – green electricity is usually a bit more expensive, but if you implement some energy saving measures (see point 2), it shouldn’t be noticeable. Power plant on your balcony Many of our Green PearlsⓇ partners generate their own electricity. Some accommodations, such as the newly opened OLM Nature Escape in South Tyrol, are completely energy self-sufficient. Many others generate at least a large percentage of their own power. Das Rübezahl, for example, a boutique hotel in southern Germany near Neuschwanstein Castle, has been generating about 90 percent of its electricity needs since 2021 with its own photovoltaic system and a combined heat and power plant. If you want to be an active part of the energy transition, but don’t have the opportunity to install a full rooftop solar system or geothermal probes right now, you could consider a balcony power plant. This is particularly worthwhile if you have a south-facing balcony. A Balcony Power Plant is a small, plug-and-play solar system that allows you to generate up to 600 watts of electricity (soon to be 800 watts) without the need for permits or bureaucratic hurdles. #2: Power consumption You can reduce power consumption in every area of your home. This not only conserves resources, but also saves you money. Electricity is often used unnecessarily anyway due to standby functions, etc. These are the top 10 energy wasters in the home, according to EON: Although televisions and wireless LANs are at the bottom of the list, it’s estimated that our entertainment devices consume about one-third of all electricity! So it reallly pays to use energy efficient devices. Sleep without “electrosmog “ All electrical devices (including household appliances, telephones, etc.) emit a certain amount of radiation. It is not really “smog”, which is a very high level of pollution in the air, but is commonly referred to as “electrosmog”. Even though radiation from household appliances is scientifically considered harmless to health, some people are concerned about the effects. In the Green Spirit hotels in Paris, there are rooms that use an alternative technology to shield their rooms specifically against electrosmog. If you too want to sleep “without radiation”, simply remove your cell phone from the bedroom at night and unplug other electrical devices. #3: Heating In order to save on heating costs, you can install smart heating thermostats on your radiators. The Naturhotel Outside in the Hohe Tauern Alpine National Park in East Tyrol, for example, recently made the switch. By optimizing heating curves, the hotel expects to save about 25 percent of its heating energy – without sacrificing warm rooms for guests. #4: Light Switching to LED bulbs is another way to make your home more sustainable. Unlike other bulbs, LED bulbs do not contain mercury. They also glow at full brightness when turned on and are extremely durable. Many hotels, such as the Biohotel Bella Vista Zermatt, have long used LEDs in combination with timers and motion detectors and thus save a lot of energy. And of course, remember to always turn the lights off when you leave the room 🙂 #5 Repair, renovate and restore Renovating or restoring old buildings and furniture saves plenty of resources and contributes to significantly lower CO2 emissions than constantly buying and building new things. Best of all, old materials tell countless stories, decades and sometimes centuries old, creating an exceptional atmosphere. One such example is the Hotel Klosterbräu in Seefeld, Tyrol. The hotel was built on 500-year-old monastery walls and has been family owned for 200 years. The Seyrling family has skillfully highlighted the old walls through careful renovations. Purchasing new furniture is often cheaper than keeping old furniture. However, you won’t get the same quality, and cheap pressed furniture can emit harmful substances like formaldehyde. In my own experience, the cost of an upholsterer to restore an old couch is more than the price of a new one. But eventually, we were able to choose the exact fabric we wanted, the couch already fit perfectly in the corner, and he even made matching pillowcases and a throw for us. In the end, we supported local crafts and did something for sustainability. The Gut Sonnenhausen eco-hotel near Munich is home to beautiful old, restored 18th-century farm cupboards. Tip: For some great upcycling ideas for your home, check out this blog post on upcycling inspiration. #6 Natural Materials Being surrounded by furnishing made of natural materials simply makes you feel more comfortable. The local Swiss stone pine wood, for example, is said to have a calming and sleep-inducing effect, which you can learn more about in our blog post on Swiss stone pine wood. At the Lifestylehotel SAND on the Timmendorfer Strand, you’ll sleep especially well on natural beds from Coco-Mat, which are hand-made in Greece using renewable raw materials such as cotton, algae, wool and wood. In general, more and more hotels are starting to build entire hotel rooms from natural materials that are fully compostable or recyclable, in line with the principles of the circular economy.  The SCHWARZWALD PANORAMA recently received an award for its “Circular Living” hotel room concept. It won third place in the German Tourism Award and was also one of the three finalists for the “German Corporate Sustainability Award.” #7 Saving water Most of us don’t want to do without the warm shower – especially in winter. Thereby we accept that we use huge quantities of water just to enjoy it on our skin one minute longer. That is why the Hotel Luise relies on the showers by Orbital Systems, which the Swedish enterprise originally developed for NASA. Meanwhile, these showers are not only to be found in the Hotel Luise, but you can also buy them for your home. Due to a special technology the water is purified in a closed loop and continually reused while you are showering. Thereby you do not only save 90 % of water and energy, but you can also take your shower with a clear conscience. #8 Clean – without chemicals! Many of our partner hotels, like the HUBERTUS Mountain Refugio Allgäu or the Hotel Weihrerhof in South Tyrol, rely on Miro steam cleaners or micro dry steam cleaners. According to the Hotel Weihrerhof, they can also be used to clean upholstered furniture and curtains. Advantages of micro-steam cleaning: Steam cleaners are also available for home use. While smaller in size, they are a promising option for environmentally friendly cleaning. The list of natural cleaning products in supermarkets and drugstores is growing, making it easy for even the average consumer to do without dry cleaning. Most cleaning jobs can be done with just a few household products, such as vinegar essence, baking soda, soda, and citric acid. #9 Zero-Waste kitchen A large part of our daily waste is produced in the kitchen due to the packaging of pre-prepared food as well as fresh ingredients. On the weekly markets in your city you can usually buy regional and above all seasonal ingredients without plastic packaging that you can directly put into your shopping bag. There is also a lot of food that you can grow at home. Just keep in mind: where there is a will there is way. For example, the Gili Lankanfushi on the Maldives managed to create an organic garden by means of a special composting system: that way, potatoes, carrots and much more grow in a place where before there has only been sand. So, if you do not have a garden, you can be creative in your kitchen using vertical indoor wall gardens, flower boxes for your windowsill or simply a few herbs in a pot. #10 Become a little more vegan Now that we’ve considered zero-waste, electricity and water consumption, let’s take a look at what we eat. It is a well-known fact that animal products in particular cause a lot of climate-damaging greenhouse gases. One alternative is to opt for a vegan diet. The LA VIMEA Hotel in South Tyrol is the first purely vegan hotel in Italy – you won’t find any animal products here. Other hotels are less radical but have added vegan alternatives to their menus and breakfast buffets. How about homemade hummus for a change, or vegan chocolate brownies? Both recipes stem from Hotel Paradiso Pure.Living on the Alpe di Siusi, which caters to vegans and vegetarians. Did we forget anything? Most certainly!

Forest bathing: Interview with trainer Lara,"What comes to your mind when you think about going to India? Inspiring Ayurveda retreats? The impressive backwaters of Kerala? Or the dusty megacities? Today we introduce you to a very special hotel, away from the hectic everyday life of the big Indian cities:  the extensive region of Wild Mahseer stretches within the green countryside of the Eastern Himalayas along the banks of the mighty Brahmaputra river. A paradise for nature lovers and peace seekers from all over the world. Community-based tourism for authentic experiences In the tea region Assam, you can find the “Eastern Himalayan Botanic Ark”: a nature park home to an impressive flora and fauna featuring a sustainable tourism concept. Wild Mahseer unites an eco-hotel, homestays and love for nature. If you really want to experience the authentic tea region of Assam and the culture of India, Wild Mahseer is happy to organize a night with a host family. During a homestay in one of the small communities, you can not only explore the village, but also enjoy the delicious, home-made cuisine, help with agricultural work or give traditional handicrafts a try. You can also enjoy the impressive, untouched nature and learn more about how conscious the locals treat nature. It’s all about tea! Among some other states Assam is one of the so-called sister cities of India: they are only connected by a thin corridor with the rest of the country and are located east of Bangladesh. Even today, most people probably still know the region because of the famous black tea. The Wild Mahseer is located on a former tea plantation. The history of the Wild Mahseer is closely related to the history of tea: from 1864, the area was used by the British Assam Tea Company for the tea trade in the colonial era. The original buildings form today’s nature hotel and have been restored with great attention to detail, preserving as much as possible. The rooms are located in the partially 145-year-old buildings, where the colonial masters used to live. As you enter, it feels as if taking a step into bygone times. The eastern region of the Himalayas is still characterized by tea cultivation and its extensive plantations. Located in the tea growing area of Addabarie, the Wild Mahseer also offers a variety of tea tourism activities and experiences, ranging from the history and culture of tea-drinking to tea-tastings, workshopsto learn about the different qualities of teaand even the opportunity to create your own personal tea blend to take back home! If you love tea, you won’t be bored here 🙂 Mindfulness & relaxation in nature Together with the Balipara Foundation, who founded Wild Mahseer, the hotel campaigns for respectful tourism, environmental protection and species conservation in the eastern Himalayas. Incidentally, the Balipara Foundation recently planted 284,722 trees in 78 villages in 30 minutes along with other organizations! A great project to protect the ecosystem, to support the communities and at the same time to draw attention to the great importance of the forests. Stroll through the dense forests of the Eastern Himalayan Botanic Ark to bring body, mind and soul into harmony while jungle bathing. Inspired by the Japanese forest bathing (Shinrin-Yoku), you slowly stroll through the jungle, listen to the sounds of the animals and hear the rustling of the trees, feel the ground under your feet and the bark of the tree at your fingertips, finding relaxation and your inner self. By the way, here you can find our articles on forest bathing as well as forest bathing in our partner hotels. The untouched nature is also the ideal place for a yoga retreat. At Wild Mahseer, you can participate in various yoga practices such as hatha and vinyasa yoga, pranayama or moon yoga. Whether you want to explore the diverse flora and fauna, get to know old traditions and cultures or just relax in your bungalow and enjoy the delicious, regional cuisine – the Wild Mahseer is simply a special, sustainable and relaxing place.

How to identify sustainable accommodation? (7-Point-Check),"Ayurveda, the “knowledge of life”, is a traditional Indian healing art, widely practiced to this day, especially in India, Nepal and Sri Lanka. Here, it is partly on a par with classical medicine. Ayurveda is considered the oldest health system in the world. More than 5000 years old writings prove how far the holistic health concept reaches back into history. Probably even further, since many practices and knowledge were passed on primarily by word of mouth. In the Western world, Ayurveda has become increasingly well-known and popular in recent years, especially in connection with wellness. Many of the Green Pearls® hotels focus on the Ayurveda principle in the wellness area and in the kitchen as well. In this article we have introduced you to the Indian CGH Earth Hotel SwaSwara, where Ayurveda plays a particularly important role. Now we want to dive a little deeper and find out more about the holistic concept. All things are interrelated Ayurveda is a combination of thousands of years of experience, knowledge and philosophy that focuses on the physical, mental, emotional and spiritual aspects of our lives. Since everything is connected with each other, the ancient Indian art of healing has a holistic approach: central elements are massage and cleansing techniques, nutritional science, a spiritual yoga practice and herbal medicine. All applications and life practices are aimed at increasing our well-being and preventing disease. Detoxification and purification of the body are among the main goals. Stress management, improving fitness, and connection to nature also play an important role in Ayurveda. From all these elements, a holistic and sustainable lifestyle emerges, characterized by respect for the environment and mindfulness in dealing with your own body. Three Doshas in Balance A central term in Ayurveda is “dosha,” which is used to describe the basic energies of the body. Two of the five elements are assigned to each dosha: They determine our individual constitutions and regulate the various physical and mental functions. If there is an imbalance, it can lead to discomfort and illness. Accordingly, at the beginning of an Ayurvedic treatment, the individual constitution of the doshas is first determined in order to subsequently bring them into balance. At this point you should keep in mind: We all have a different composition of the doshas, which has developed from our experiences and our lifestyle in the course of life. So most of us have a tendency towards one or even two doshas and are therefore called e.g. Pitta-type or Vata-Kapha-type. Ayurvedic massages, treatments, yoga and nutrition take this into consideration. In order to restore balance between the doshas and to eliminate accumulated toxins and waste products, nutritional therapy, various herbs and oils, as well as certain cleansing procedures, known as Panchakarma, are used. Panchakarma includes fasting and (steam) baths. Enemas, therapeutic vomiting and bloodletting are also among the traditional practices, though these are found in Ayurveda hotels only in a weakened or modified form (e.g., as a laxative cure). More common, are massages, yoga and breathing exercises, color and music therapies, and Ayurvedic cuisine with corresponding workshops, such as those offered at Hubertus Mountain Refugio, LA VIMEA, or CERVO Mountain Resort Zermatt. The Ayurvedic way of life at a glance The nutritional principles Food plays a substantial role at the whole Ayurveda. This means that your choice of food should be tailored to your individual dosha constitution, as this also influences your digestion. Even the healthiest food is useless if your body cannot process it well. Therefore, in Ayurvedic cuisine raw food is rarely found, almost all dishes are cooked, sweet meals are often served before the main meal as they are more difficult to digest. In addition, much emphasis is placed on ensuring that a meal requires you to perform all the functions of eating – biting, sucking, chewing, licking, swallowing – and that the taste sensations (“rasas”) sour, salty, bitter, tart and spicy are combined in a harmonious way. Again, attention is paid to your individual dosha composition. In Ayurvedic cooking, there are ten royal spices that are said to have great healing powers, including cumin, turmeric, fennel and coriander. And it is also quite tasty, especially if you enjoy it with other people in a calm and relaxed atmosphere. Furthermore, it’s based on a particularly nice basic rule: “When you eat, eat.” So don’t play around on your cell phone 😉 Massages and treatments Ayurvedic massages also focus on doing something good for your body holistically, purifying and detoxifying it and releasing blockages in the body and mind. For this purpose, besides the hands of the therapists, mainly sesame oil mixed with herbs is used in a variety of ways. Ayurveda and Yoga Gentle movement sessions in the form of a spiritual yoga practice are an integral part of Ayurvedic teachings. Depending on the Dosha, you can activate your body and charge it with energy or calm down the fire and restlessness in you. You can easily integrate such yoga exercises into your everyday life at home. For example, how about a short stretching session after getting up or after work? Ayurveda as a lifestyle is a way to change your body and mind for the better. If you want to dive deeper into the topic, we would encourage you to go on an Ayurveda retreat or to book a stay in an Ayurveda hotel. The advantage there is that you are out of your everyday environment and can therefore learn and implement new behaviors more easily. Even more so when you are guided by the trained experts of our Green Pearls® partners. Here you can find more on the topics of Ayurveda and Far-Eastern medicine:

Recycling instead of discarding – how hotels use food waste,"“Female Solo Travel” is as popular as never before. No wonder, since you can be more spontaneous, flexible, independent, and open to making new friends when traveling alone. However, women traveling on their own for the first time are skeptical – in particular concerning the safety of specific regions. India is one destination related to those worries. We collected some useful tips for your journey. Being prepared appropriately should encourage women visiting this wonderful country solo. Inform yourself in advance, respect the local culture The more you know about a country’s cultural practices beforehand, the better you can adapt to them. An important issue concerning women is clothing: shoulders and legs should be covered in conservative countries such as India. The easiest way doing so is by wearing light cloth pants and traditional Indian tunics. Buying it locally provides you with a great souvenir on top.
A basic rule for your safety, not only when traveling is finding out about and avoiding places known for crime. Moreover, you should learn about the local courtesies and stick to them. It is always helpful to know some words in the native language to socialize and learn about the culture more easily. That way, you can simply emphasize saying no if necessary, or terminate a conversation you are not feeling comfortable with. Travel with a positive attitude You quickly miss kind gestures and attentions if you suspect threats everywhere and expect foreigners meaning mischief. Being dismissive toward your surroundings makes you automatically tense and insecure. A poor condition– not only for enjoying your journey and encountering others in an unprejudiced manner but also for appearing confidently and communicating clearly.
Generally, you should observe yourself and your surroundings with open eyes and pay attention to body language more than usual, especially your own. Behavior common at homelike touching someone’s arm while talking, might send another signal than intended abroad. A basic principle for your social interaction in a foreign country:being polite and approachable, yet keeping physical distance to prevent misunderstandings. Enjoy Kerala’s diverse nature For those traveling India for the first time (alone), the region of Kerala in Southwest Indiais highly recommended. Among the Indian states, Kerala’s social system is one of those most developed. At the same time, the region offers a lot to discover. Kerala is particularly famous for its “Backwaters,” a widely ramified net of waterways, lakes, and lagoons – various nature wonders entertaining you unaccompanied. Coconut Lagoon Resort’s team is on hand with help and advice, no matter if you need ideas for excursions, help with transportation, or have general questions. Be open-minded towards the local culture The Indian CGH Earth Hotels encourage you, and especially female solo travelers, to get involved with locals and their traditions. Here, it is easy to get in contact with the people and the everyday life on site: the lifestyle of the tribal village in Thekkady can be discovered in Spice Village where cooking classes are offered teaching you the secrets of the Indian cuisine. Directly at the sea, you can find Marari Beach architecturally inspired by the fishing culture of the surrounding villages. It collaborates with the residents supporting and maintaining traditional handcrafting and the way of living. If you are in the mood for yoga and meditation, you find the perfect spot for recovering your balance at SwaSwara in Gokarna, round 500 kilometers north. Do you like this article? Share it!"
Green Wedding: special places for a special day,"This summer (here in Germany) was totally inadequate. Do you agree? Do you want to enjoy the sun again before it turns into winter? Then you’re just like us! Not entirely unselfishly, we have selected seven warm destinations with sustainable accommodations for October and November, where you can count on sun and summer feelings! Sustainable vacation destinations near the equator As a rule of thumb, the closer you are to the equator (the imaginary line that runs through the center of the earth between the northern and southern hemispheres), the warmer it is. Because of the sun’s position, there are no seasons here, but it is always warm – around 90 degrees Fahrenheit (30 degrees Celsius). #1 The Maldives – 65 kilometers from the equator The Maldives, with over 1,100 islands south of India, look like they are right on the equator. The closest island, Gan, is actually only 65 kilometers away, while Malé is about 465 kilometers away. They lie in the northern hemisphere. Weather in Malé in October/November: In October and November you can expect a fairly constant temperature of around 90 °F (30 °C). October marks the end of the rainy season (May to October), with an average of two hours of rain per day during this month. Sustainable accommodation: At Gili Lankanfushi, you will stay in luxurious villas built on stilts over the water. The coral reefs and colorful fish life make the resort a diver’s paradise. The resort’s sustainable initiatives include a coral protection project, which you can visit with the resort’s marine biologist. #2 Indonesia – 555 km from the equator Indonesia consists of over 17,000 islands and is located in the Southern Hemisphere, about 555 kilometers from the equator. The most famous island is Bali, which is 935 kilometers away. The weather in Bali in October/November: Temperatures vary little and are around 88 °F (31 °C). The water temperature is 80,6 °F (27 °C). The rainy season starts in November. This means that it rains for one to two hours in the afternoon. Shorter showers of about 30 minutes are also possible in between. When it rains in Bali, you can follow the local trend of “yoga in the rain”, go scuba diving, or visit temples. Sustainable accommodation: Puri Dajuma Cottages & Spa is a beautiful resort with Balinese villas surrounded by tropical plants, a pool area, a fine sandy beach and direct access to the sea. The resort uses a variety of environmentally friendly measures and offers eco-tours that respect the culture and customs of the area. #3 Thailand (Phuket and Ko Phi Phi) – 860 kilometers north of the equator Thailand lies north of the equator, but not far from it. The island of Phuket is about 900 kilometers above the longest parallel, and the island of Koh Phi Phi is only 860 kilometers above it. In total, Thailand has over 500 islands, some of which are uninhabited. Weather on the Thai Islands in October/November: The temperature is fairly constant at around 86 °F (30 °C). October marks the end of the rainy season, although the rainy season means that it rains an average of 20 days a month with short, heavy showers. After that, the sun often shines, and since it is lush and green due to the abundance of rain, this is a great time to take beautiful landscape photos. November marks the beginning of the high tourist season. Sustainable accommodation in Phuket: An extraordinary resort awaits you in the treetops of the Enchanted Forest at Keemala. There is also a large garden with local fruits, vegetables and herbs used in the cooking classes. Sustainable accommodation on Koh Phi Phi Leh: Zeavola is a luxury dive resort offering PADI scuba diving courses. You stay in Thai-style bungalows surrounded by a true garden and forest paradise. Bird watchers will love it here. Excursion: How much does it rain at the equator and when is the best time to travel? The high levels of solar radiation at the equator throughout the year cause clouds to form and rain to fall. The “seasons” of the tropics are rainy seasons. There is a rainy season and a dry season. The common assumption that the dry season is the “good season” and the rainy season is the “bad season” is not true. By definition is the tropical rainy season But the rainy season can be cancelled. Or it can be stronger, weaker, earlier, later, shorter or longer than expected. (You know how it is with weather forecasts.) Holidays on the Canary Islands in October and November If you are looking for a vacation destination that is pleasantly warm (around 82,2°F (28°C)) and has many hours of sunshine in October and November, but not quite as far away as Thailand or Indonesia, then the Canary Islands are perfect. Generally it rains very little in the canaries – only a few days a year! Warm and dry Located off the northwest coast of Africa in the Atlantic Ocean, the Canary Islands are about 3,000 kilometers from the equator. Due to their geographical location and the Gulf Stream, it is warm and dry all year round. Let’s look at two islands as examples: Gran Canaria, perhaps the best known of the archipelago, and Tenerife, the largest. Weather in Gran Canaria in autumn: Gran Canaria is considered the warmest island in the fall. Even in November, the air temperature is usually between 73 ( 23°C) and 82 ( 28°C) and the water temperature is around 70 ( 20°C). Green PearlsⓇ Hotel on Gran Canaria: The small boutique hotel Casa León – Royal Retreat is located inland and is surrounded by 10,000 square meters of gardens with native plants. There is a daily (free) shuttle to the beach and you can enjoy a wonderful break here. Weather in Tenerife in October and November: “At this time of year you can spend the whole day outdoors, swimming in the sea and enjoying the gentle sun”, says the team of the OCÈANO Health Spa Hotel. In the fall, the temperature is between 62 and 70 °F (22 and 26 °C) and, as in Gran Canaria, the water temperature is around 80 °F (20 °C). Sustainable accommodation in Tenerife: The OCÈANO Health Spa Hotel is located in the north of the island, directly on the Atlantic Ocean. The large panoramic windows offer an uninterrupted view of the sea. The health hotel offers an extensive sports and nutrition program. Sicily: Hot summers, mild winters Another recommendation for a warm autumn vacation is Sicily. Sicily is the largest island in the Mediterranean and is located southwest of the Tip of the Boot. It is about 4,000 kilometers from the equator. Weather in Sicily in October and November: In late summer it is still warm (around 77°F (25°C)) and the water is still pleasant for swimming. You can also expect many hours of sunshine. However, it rains more often during this time (expect about 8 days of rain per month). Sustainable hotel in Sicily: The ADLER Spa Resort SICILIA will open in the summer of 2022 and is a beautiful, luxurious resort located directly on a natural beach protected by the WWF and accessible only from the resort. Traveling in times of climate change As you probably already know, global warming doesn’t just mean that it’s warming up a degree, it means that ecosystems around the world, from coral reefs to mountain glaciers, are being disrupted. The consequences are even more extreme. 2023 has been dubbed the “year of climate records” by Geo. In 2024 we had floods in Germany and a heat wave in Southern Europe with extreme temperatures of over 40 degrees (June 2024 was the hottest month in Greece in 164 years of weather records). In Brazil, people died from heavy rains, and in Mexico, water became so scarce from drought that the population, industry, politics, and farmers were drawn into serious conflicts. The equatorial weather zone will shift Also interesting (and alarming!) is that climate change will also cause climate zones to shift. At least that’s what researchers in California think. In their study, they predict that the equatorial rain belt will shift north over the Indian Ocean (Asia) and south over the Atlantic Ocean (South America). This could lead to increased flooding in southern India and drought stress in Central America. To avoid further global warming, we must all work to reduce man-made greenhouse gases. Most of this concerns energy consumption and industry, but the tourism industry also needs to rethink. We addressed this issue in our blog post ” Are we still allowed to fly? However, because sustainability is not just about carbon footprints, but also about social sustainability, for example in tourism, we believe that travel – even to far-flung destinations – remains important. Balancing act We hope that our little essay on climate and the destinations presented here has helped you plan your trip. By the way, being concerned about climate change and sustainability doesn’t mean you can’t plan your vacation based on where it’s “nice” at the moment. But it should encourage us all to make climate-conscious choices when traveling and to support accommodations that have already recognized this. Still looking for inspiration for your fall vacation in the South? Then save this post to your Pinterest board!"
Green Wedding: special places for a special day,"The sound of the ocean, an endless horizon, the surface of the water glistening in the sun, and fine, soft sand under your feet… There is something special about sandy beaches, and we all understand, why they belong to the most popular vacation destinations. But did you know that sand is a finite resource and that entire stretches of coastline are already depleted? Learn about the state of our beaches, the importance of a sustainable beach vacation, and what it looks like. Sand – Our most important resource after water Like the sand of the sea. Meaning: infinitely available. But this general saying is no longer true. Sand is the most used resource in the world (after water). This is due to concrete – a mixture of cement with sand/gravel and water. It has been the most widely used building material since the 19th century, especially in urban construction. As we reported in this blog post about villages in motion, more and more people are moving to cities, and the construction boom there is consuming huge amounts of concrete, both for buildings and infrastructure. Using sand, Singapore added landmass The biggest consumers of sand today are Asia’s booming economies. Singapore, for example, has dumped 500 million tons into the sea to gain land. According to Deutschlandfunk, the sand came from Indonesia, Cambodia, Malaysia, and Thailand. By sucking the sand from the seabed, 24 sand islands in Indonesia sank. In response, Indonesia, Cambodia, and Malaysia have already banned the export of their sand. Experts expect Africa to follow suit in the coming years. With rapidly growing populations, cities will expand and grow explosively. Sand theft for luxury resorts? In 2008, a sand heist in Jamaica made headlines when 500 truckloads of the finest sand were stolen overnight from a fishing village. It will take several hundred years for that beach – and the local habitat – to regenerate. The theft was a disaster for the local ecosystem. The case was never solved, but the fine sand was probably sold to luxury resorts for their beaches. There have also been several reports of sand robbery around Lake Victoria in East Africa. This shows that the resource is not only freely available in abundance but also valuable and desirable. 1.   Rule: You must come to the beach, not the beach to you! Don’t support hotels that have a fine sandy beach right outside while the rest of the coast is rocky or pebbly. Sure, there are some natural sandy beaches among rocks, but always ask yourself if that is the case here. Purchased sandy beaches come from a different ecosystem and are missing there! Moreover, the artificial transport of sand to the coast is not ecological. So, either accept the rocky beach and enjoy the rugged landscape, or find a destination where the beach is as natural as you want it to be. Sustainable eco-hotels on dream beaches At Green PearlsⓇ you’ll find some green pearls that are located right on beautiful beaches and are also committed to sustainability. Here is a brief look at six of them: #1: ADLER Spa Resort SICILIA – Protected beach The six-kilometer-long beach in front of the ADLER Spa Resort SICILIA is a WWF protected area and one of the most beautiful beaches in Sicily. Since the beach of the “Riserva Naturale Torre Salsa” is lined with dunes and cliffs, you will hardly find any tourists except for the guests of the resort. The staff works with the WWF to preserve biodiversity and the local ecosystem, and regularly cleans the beach of washed-up plastic. Experience a protected and well-kept beach in southern Italy. #2 Cerf Island Resort in the Seychelles – Dream Beach on a Water Reserve Cerf Island is only 1.5 km long and 1 km wide. So, you are amidst pure sandy beaches. And there’s more. The crystal clear waters with its colorful underwater world and mangrove trees are part of the Saint-Anne National Marine Park. Guided tours through the National Marine Park – either above the water on kayak tours or underwater with diving and snorkeling – will teach you a lot about life in the Indian Ocean. #3 Puri Dajuma – Eco-resort with private beach in Bali Bali is famous for its white dream beaches, tropical nature and magical atmosphere. Puri Dajuma is an eco-resort that focuses on waste reduction, social responsibility, and sustainable tourism. Stay in small, luxurious Balinese-style cottages on a private, picture-postcard beach. Tip: Before you pack your bags and travel to Bali, we recommend you to read our article about Bali and its dark side. For example, a local tells you what tourists often do wrong in Bali. #4 Zeavola – Barefoot in luxury on Koh Phi Phi Leh in Thailand Barefoot in luxury is the lifestyle you can enjoy at Zeavola. Stay in naturally designed villas and drift between beach, culinary delights, and spa – always feeling the sand beneath your feet. Located on the Thai island of Koh Phi Phi Leh, the resort also offers PADI scuba diving courses, where experienced guides introduce you to the beautiful underwater world of coral reefs. #5 Gili Lankanfushi – Fine sand, palms and corals At Gili Lankanfushi, rooms are not on the beach overlooking the ocean – they are on the ocean overlooking the beach! As the lowest country in the world, the Maldives are the most affected by rising sea levels. You can read more about this in our blog on endangered islands. This makes it all the more important to focus on sustainable tourism and choose an eco-friendly resort, like Gili Lankanfushi. #6 Lifestylehotel SAND at the Baltic Sea Beach The Lifestylehotel SAND is located in the second row of the German Baltic Sea beach in Timmendorfer Strand. As the Baltic Sea can be quite windy, it’s best to book a typical wicker beach chair on the beach. That way you only have the sand under your feet and not everywhere else. As the name of the hotel suggests, the sand of the Baltic Sea beach is a source of inspiration for the sustainable and natural design of the hotel. 9 Tips for a sustainable beach vacation Vacation by the sea – without a sandy beach Not every coast has a sandy beach. And ecologically speaking, it would be completely wrong for tourists to expect sandy beaches everywhere – and thus indirectly contribute to sand depletion (keyword: supply and demand). However, many countries have found ways to make even steep coastlines attractive. “Here in Tenerife, the “piscinas naturales” are widespread and very popular with both guests and locals,” says the OCÉANO Health Spa Hotel. “They are sheltered pools in the sea that fill with natural seawater. One is right in front of the OCÉANO”. We hope we have given you some good tips for your next beach vacation and helped you appreciate (and protect) the natural wonder that is sand). PS: People are already thinking about how to build when the sand really runs out. Recycled concrete is the answer. Unfortunately, there is still little interest in the industry. Our prediction: As long as politicians do not pass laws and force the industry to do so, nothing will happen in the area of sand conservation. This makes it all the more important to support sustainability and resource conservation wherever we can. Save this article for your next beach vacation."
The most beautiful eco yoga retreats near and far,"Breathtaking scenery, endless rice paddies and palm forests, summer temperatures, and white dream beaches are attracting more and more people to Bali. The Indonesian island has been one of the most popular travel destinations in recent years. The ever-increasing number of visitors has turned into mass tourism, which has left its mark. Littered beaches are just one example. One or two doubts can easily catch up with you whether you should follow the Bali trend or not. Like so many things, there are two sides to a vacation in Bali because the locals live from tourism. So it’s up to you to shape your Bali vacation. With these ideas and eco accommodations, you can travel green to Bali and give something back at the same time. 5 reasons not to travel to Bali There are a few things that speak against a trip to Bali – starting with the journey: Getting to an island is costly, and flights, as well as boat trips, are not very climate-friendly. Bali, in particular, is one of the destinations that people visit again and again because of cheap flights and only for a short stay – although for many it is a long-distance trip. Info: You can stay in Bali for 30 days without a visa. A visa for 60 days currently costs 87 euros and can be extended to six months. Find out more here. #1 Garbage problem in Bali The beautiful white sandy beaches for which Bali is so famous sometimes resemble more carpets of plastic waste than paradise. This is marine plastic, which washes up in huge quantities during a constellation of strong westerly winds and currents. In just a few days, over 100 tons can lie in the sand at once. Local garbage collectors and volunteers then spend days cleaning up the beaches. As the newspaper “Bali Sun” reports, some tourists also take part in such clean-ups. Mass tourism has significantly increased the garbage problem on the island. Because where there are more people, there is also more garbage. On top of that, they also want to be fed and need resources, which are scarce on an island per se. Since February 2024, tourists have had to pay an entry tax of 150,000 rupiah (approx. 9 euros) when entering the country. According to Al Jazeera, this tax was introduced specifically to combat the waste problem. #2 Damage to the culture When traveling, people don’t always consider that the authentic culture of a region often suffers from the tourists’ urge to experience it. Since 2023, you have been asked to download a catalog of etiquette rules to your cell phone via QR code when entering the country, where you are specifically asked to treat the shrines with respect. (You can find out more about this in the section “7 things tourists do wrong in Bali”) One reason for this new code of conduct is said to be Russian expats in particular. Since the Russia-Ukraine war, many Russians have made their way to the surfers’ paradise before they could be drafted into military service. Ukrainians have also come for the same reason. #3 Water shortage on the dream island Back in 2012, Stroma Cole pointed out in her study “A Political Ecology of Water Equity and Tourism – A Case Study from Bali” that tourism consumed over 65 percent of the water and that hotels and luxury resorts used groundwater for their pools while the locals’ wells dried up. As Al Jazeera English reported in this video in 2019, too low a groundwater level on the island causes the freshwater lenses to mix with the salty seawater. The IDEP’s Bali Water Protection project is working on the ground. Among other things, they are building cisterns for the population to use rainwater. #4 “Sex ban” in Bali? This is no reason to miss out on a trip to Bali (because it’s not true at all), but since there have been headlines about it, we’d like to clear things up here: In 2025, a law will come into force in Indonesia that prohibits a man and a woman who are neither related nor married from booking a hotel room together. However, due to various hurdles (who can report whom, when and how), this law is designed from the outset in such a way that it only affects Indonesians themselves and not tourists and certainly not tourists in Bali. As you probably know, Indonesia is an Islamic country, but in Bali most of the inhabitants are Hindus. #5 In Bali, you are a mass tourist There’s no other way to put it because Bali is one of the most famous tourist islands in the world. Many people find this mix of surfers, expats, honeymooners and locals so exciting. However, wanting to go exactly where everyone else is going has many downsides, as we explain in more detail in our blog article on over-tourism. In the long term, it would be best if tourism were spread out over more islands. Many people are already traveling to the Gili Islands. The neighboring island of Lombok is still a little quieter. The solution? Plan, inform, and act consciously If you plan a few things in advance, you can easily implement environmentally friendly actions during your vacation. Slow travel instead of Instagram hopping And another important keyword for your green trip is slow travel. Take your time for your vacation on the island and don’t just go there for a few days. You can find more tips on how to travel eco-friendly and green in general (which are of course also Bali-friendly) in our blog articles on social sustainability and animal welfare when traveling. 7 things tourists do wrong in Bali In 2023, the Indonesian Lucienne Anhar, who lives in Bali, reported on Buisness Insider how Bali has changed since the 1980s as a result of tourists. She points out things that many tourists unfortunately don’t know, but which Balinese consider to be disrespectful or unwise: Ecotourism with a dream beach in Puri Dajuma Choosing the right accommodation is significant if you decide to travel to Bali. In the west of Bali, you will find the Puri Dajuma eco-resort with a hotel and cottages located directly on a beautiful beach. The cottages were built from local materials in the Balinese architectural style and are scattered among tropical trees. In addition to traditional Balinese massages and wellness treatments, you can take cooking classes and get to know the traditional cuisine. Authentic experiences like these help you to better understand and appreciate the region, as you gain insights into its characteristics and thus better understand the traditions and people. Of course, the cooking here is organic. In addition to many other activities such as yoga, you can also book eco-tours to Pekutatan in the Pulukan eco-tourism area. Explore plantations of rubber trees, coconuts, and bananas and learn how cloves and vanilla grow. You enjoy your packed lunch at an altitude of 300 meters with a view of rice fields and the ocean. As you can see, with the right preparation, you can always find responsible alternatives to classic mass tourism – even in Bali.

The most beautiful eco yoga retreats near and far,"The wake-up service at the hotel was something I used to enjoy. It was part of the luxury of being taken care of. Eventually, though, I let my smartphone do the waking. But still, I ask myself, why? And what do hotels have to offer today to make waking up a special experience? From Knocker-Up to Electronic Wake-Up – A brief history In the past, people didn’t have their own alarm clocks. On farms, the rooster crowed, and in towns, there was the knocker-up. This was someone who, for a small fee, knocked on people’s windows in the morning to wake them up for work. You can find stories about such people in the urban history of working-class cities like Manchester or in books (e.g. Charles Dickens’ Great Expectations, 1861). Ramadan drummer Here in Jerusalem, there is a group of young men with drums who parade through the streets during Ramadan to wake the residents for breakfast and early prayers before sunrise. After all, the whole day must be spent fasting from sunrise. We are always happy to see them at the window – especially as they are often dressed in traditional clothes. You can also find such drummers in Turkey, Egypt, and many other Islamic countries such as Indonesia. (However, you won’t see or hear them at tourist resorts like Puri Dajuma Cottages & Spa on the beach in Bali. You would have to live in a Muslim neighborhood in Jakarta or somewhere similar.) Hotel wake-up service As I mentioned before, I loved the hotel’s wake-up service. You dialed the front desk number (on the nightstand phone next to the bed) and ordered a wake-up service. “Hello, I’d like to be woken up at 8 a.m. tomorrow,” “Gladly. Will a phone call suffice, or would you like someone to knock?” – Something along those lines. The phone rings the next day at 8 a.m. on the dot. “Good morning, this is your wake-up call” and “Is there anything else I can do for you?” and “The breakfast buffet is waiting for you.” Oh, I tell you, waking up in a hotel is really wonderful! In fact, getting a good night’s sleep is a top priority for many travelers. As Booking.com found in a survey of 27,000 travelers, “rest & relaxation” is important to 67% of all travelers, and 58% would even be interested in a sleep retreat. “The wake-up service is ordered about once a year” Wake-up calls are still free at the Weiherhof Hotel on Wolfsgruben Lake in Ritten, South Tyrol, but hardly anyone uses them anymore. Owner Klaus Pichler laughed when we asked. About once a year a guest asks for a wake-up call, he says. Since it is no longer part of the morning routine at the reception, it is “almost a challenge” not to forget this request. Other Green PearlsⓇ partners tell us similar stories. If you would like a wake-up service, everyone is happy to oblige. (Maybe you want to try it on your next trip :-)) Only no one asks anymore. Or maybe the priorities are elsewhere: “We are happy to offer a wake-up service. But most of our guests are on vacation and prefer to sleep in!” – Eco-Aparthotel The Dreamers Club (Island of Korčula, Croatia) Waking up in a hotel – the new luxury So, what does waking up in sustainable hotels look like nowadays? Here are a few examples: Sun tracking blinds At the HUBERTUS Mountain Refugio Allgäu you are surrounded by nature. Hiking and biking trails in the alpine landscape await you right outside the door. Many guests come here to relax and enjoy wellness and yoga retreats. Here the sun will wake you up. There are automatic blinds, always closed at night, letting the early morning light into your room (if your curtains are open). During the day, the blinds follow the sun so that the rooms don’t heat up in summer. Wake up to the smell of freshly baked bread At the SAND lifestyle hotel on the Baltic Sea, many people enjoy a “vacation rhythm” and sit on the roof terrace well into the night. And be woken by their nose in the morning: “We have a front cooking station and bake our own rolls from pre-made dough. The smell awakens the senses without any technology. It’s the most natural way to wake up”. – Lifestyle Hotel SAND (Timmendorfer Strand, Germany) Yoga sessions in the morning Early risers can take part in morning yoga classes at Paradiso Pure.Living. The eco-friendly hotel is located on the Alp de Siusi and offers nature vacations in winter and summer. “We love the sunrise in the Dolomites. And to not miss out on this magical time of day, we offer our guests sunrise yoga as part of our free daily yoga program, which is available to all hotel guests. – Paradiso Pure.Living Breakfast for late risers If waking up to the sun in the morning is not your idea of a vacation, but rather a really long nap in a cozy bed, consider Hotel My Arbor near Brixen (also in South Tyrol). Spend the night in an extraordinary treetop hotel. “At My Arbor, everything revolves around “MY” (ME), the guest. We respect and value the personal space of our guests and want their stay to be completely according to their wishes. If someone wants to sleep in, we offer breakfast until 12:00″. – My Arbor. The breakfast basket knocks on the door You can also enjoy your personal freedom at Hygna Chalets in Tyrol’s Alpbachtal. They offer luxurious wooden chalets with private kitchens. Service includes a breakfast basket of fresh organic produce delivered to your door each morning. (The knock-up to your vacation feeling) Do wake-up services have anything to do with sustainability? The disappearance of personal service is linked to the automation and digitalization of this world. We are investing a lot of money in robots and technology and a lot less in personal service. One example: My uncle bought a robot lawnmower. 3,000 Euros to keep the grass short. For how long could he have hired a boy from the neighborhood with this money? No electronics Many people use their vacation to consciously do without technology. The nature rooms at STURM, for example, no longer have televisions, and at the aforementioned HUBERTUS Mountain Refugio, you can leave your cell phone in a “radio silence box”. It will be safely locked away for you and you will get it back at the end of your vacation (along with a piece of mountain cheese). At the Hotel Pavillon in Paris, you can even enjoy radio silence in the heart of the French capital. Some rooms are specially shielded against “electro-smog”. By taking a digital break, you are able to focus more on the real and natural world – and perhaps waking up will be a new experience for you, as there are no cell phone alarms or push-up messages. Instead, maybe a nice call from reception or just the sun. Inspired? Save this article for your next trip-planning session!"
The 5 most beautiful eco-luxury hotels in the Alps,"Clean beaches and seas, unspoiled nature in the mountains – that’s what tourists want. And hotels want to deliver. The problem is that the hotel industry itself is a major source of plastic waste. Single-use plastics in the form of typical hotel slippers, small packages in the bathroom and at the buffet, along with straws and cups, add up to mountains of plastic in conventional hotels. We took a look at sustainable Green PearlsⓇ hotels, what alternatives are available and how to avoid single-use plastics in general. The problem with disposables in hotels When you stay at a hotel, you get everything you need: your luggage is taken care of, a refreshing drink is waiting for you in your room, a variety of toiletries are available in the bathroom, towels and slippers are provided… and while you are lying by the pool or sitting in the restaurant, your room is cleaned, the bed is made and all opened tubes and packages are replaced with new ones. Sound great? For sustainability-minded travelers like you, probably not. Because: All of this (among other things) creates a lot of waste. Hotels and vacation rentals definitely have a single-use problem, and it has to do with the following:: Expensive hotels produce less waste than cheap ones According to the DEHOGA environmental brochure, 0 to 2-star hotels produce 9.1 liters of waste per guest per day, 4-star hotels 3.4 liters (5-star hotels produce slightly more at 3.7 liters). According to the German Hotel and Restaurant Association (DEHOGA), this is mainly due to disposable packaging in the lower star categories. In the upscale hotel industry, less disposable packaging is used simply for style’s sake – e.g. cloth napkins instead of paper napkins, ceramic or stainless steel milk jugs instead of plastic condensed milk containers, etc. But simply choosing a higher star rating is not enough to eliminate waste and single-use packaging. Especially since not everyone can or wants to. Above all, it takes hoteliers who really care and are committed to reducing waste in their properties. Zero waste or at least “less waste” is a central concern for Green Pearls® accommodations. Each accommodation has its own approach to waste reduction, which you can read about on the Green Pearls® pages and on their individual websites. As mentioned above, many of them are Zero Waste representatives, striving for a low environmental footprint and a circular economy in all areas. We believe that Green PearlsⓇ hotels are among the lowest waste producers in the industry. “In terms of waste and plastic reduction, sustainably certified hotels are generally more advanced than non-certified hotels.” – WWF WWF study on single-use and reusable products in the hospitality industry In 2019 and 2024, WWF Germany investigated the issue of single-use plastics in the hotel industry. For the 2019 study, WWF surveyed hotels and hotel guests in Italy, France, Greece and Spain. In 2024, the data was supplemented by expert interviews and a literature review. It found that the majority of guests use significantly more reusable packaging at home than on vacation. Hoteliers are determined to act, but face many obstacles: For every 50 million disposables, only half a million reusables are sold “In 2022, the share of reusable packaging (by number of items) in the hotel industry was only 1.2 percent. (600,000 items compared to 50.6 million disposable items) and consisted almost entirely of beverage containers.” – Untersuchung der Gesellschaft für Verpackungsmarktforschung mbH (GVM) für den WWF All too often, “habit” is to blame for not using reusable products. By the way, the WWF believes that reusable products make much more sense than disposable products made from “eco-materials”. In other words, a refillable plastic bottle is better than a disposable bamboo cup. Washable cloth napkins are better than disposable napkins made from recycled cellulose. This is how sustainable hotels avoid disposable packaging Amenities upon request Many sustainable hotels and resorts have started to remove amenities such as toothbrushes, razors, sewing kits, etc. from the rooms and store them at the front desk. That way, you still get them, but only if you really need and ask for them. “By providing standard amenities only upon request, we avoid unnecessary use,” says Farmhouse Smiling Gecko in Cambodia. The resort also offers many homemade products from the resort’s own workshops, which Smiling Gecko uses to support the local community. When it comes to the amenities that are still offered on request, sustainable accommodation also ensures that they are produced sustainably and fairly. This is what the Naturresort Gerbehof in Friedrichshafen on Lake Constance reports. Honesty bar with reusable glasses instead of a minibar The minibar is another element that must be provided to meet hotel standards. In addition to energy consumption, drinks and snacks in disposable packaging also have a negative impact on the environment. Gut Guntrams near Vienna therefore installed a “central minibar” in the form of a Honesty Bar and left the individual minibars in the rooms empty. The Honesty Bar offers homemade sweet and savory treats in reusable glass jars. Homemade welcome cookies A small welcome gift for guests is a nice touch. But as Zero Waste advocate Béá Johnson says, promotional gifts and giveaways are often a source of waste. Not so at the Hotel Bella Vista Zermatt in Switzerland. There, homemade cookies on a plate greet guests in the mountains near the Matterhorn. A water bottle for the duration of your stay Many hotels provide their guests with a refillable water bottle. At the OCÉANO Health Spa Hotel on Tenerife, the “OCÉANO Glass Bottle” is available and there are water dispensers throughout the hotel where you can refill the bottle with fresh, filtered water. This fits in with the wide range of sports and wellness activities on offer and also saves a lot of bottles and miles of transportation 🙂 Source of waste: breakfast buffet? Zero waste is also an option! One of the biggest contributors to packaging and food waste in the hotel industry is the breakfast buffet. All Green Pearls® hotels have optimized this aspect. “There are no packaged products at our breakfast buffet,” reports the APIPURA hotel rinner on the ritten in South Tyrol. Instead, the child-friendly hotel offers organic products in small jars – one of the highlights are the various types of organic honey from the hotel’s own beekeeping. Zero waste measures at the breakfast buffet: Elimination of disposable hygiene products Disposable bathroom hygiene products are the second major area where mountains of plastic waste accumulate in conventional hotels. This refers to the small packages of shampoo, shower gel, soap, body lotion, shower cap, toothbrush, razor and so on. Sustainable hotels show that these products can be provided to guests in a stylish and hygienic way and do not have to be the norm. Solid Soap and Shampoo At the Klosterhof Alpine Hideaway & Spa in Berchtesgadener Land, Bavaria, the bathroom features soap and shampoo bars, as well as refillable shower gel dispensers as an alternative to traditional bottles. You can do the same at home, by the way! Dispenser Speaking of dispensers: Another option you might want to consider for the home are refillable, larger, and often more attractive dispensers for soap, shampoo, conditioner, shower gel, and the like. According to soap manufacturer MarcelsGreenSoap, a refill bag saves 85% of plastic packaging! Almost all Green Pearls® accommodations now use dispensers – with natural ingredients. “Our shampoos and shower gels (in the dispensers) are from Tiroler Kräuterhof, so they are 100% natural and regional,” reports Summit Lodges Pfunds. Biohotel Grafenast in Tyrol even offers dispensers with arnica muscle gel for relaxation after long hikes around the Pillberg 😉 Natural cosmetics free of chemicals and microplastics For our Green PearlsⓇ partners, the use of environmentally friendly cosmetic products is very important. At Pavilions Himalayas – The Farm in Nepal, you can buy bamboo toothbrushes with hemp bristles and plastic-free toothpaste tabs made according to Ayurvedic principles, as are the other personal care products. Avoiding chemicals and microplastics is particularly important to them to protect the water quality of their organic farm.. The Green Spirit hotels in Paris (Hotel Malar, Hotel Amelie and Hotel Le Pavillon, all in the central 7th arrondissement within walking distance of the Eiffel Tower) use soaps, shampoos and shower gels from Austrian natural cosmetics company Pure Green. The luxurious Klosterbräu wellness hotel in Seefeld, Tyrol, spoils its guests with premium products from Augustinus Bader – some of which have been developed exclusively for the hotel. The Lifestylehotel SAND in Timmendorfer Strand on the Baltic Sea has embraced ‘Björk&Berries‘. Nordic, sustainable, refillable and stylish,” they say. Food from their own harvest In the hotel industry, buying food in bulk is one way to reduce unnecessary packaging. Where possible, regionally. “We work almost exclusively with local suppliers to avoid long transport routes and support the regional economy,” says My Arbor near Brixen in South Tyrol. However, food packaging is avoided in particular through direct in-house production. “From cakes to chocolates to syrups, we make everything ourselves,” explains the adults-only wellness hotel. “All our fresh fruit and vegetables come from our own farm in Albisano on Lake Garda. The owner, Mr Huber, personally takes care of the harvest and brings the produce directly to the hotel (without packaging waste) so that our guests can enjoy the freshest ingredients.” – My Arbor Dishes and glasses Disposable plastic cups at hotels? They do exist! Some hoteliers find them more convenient and less risky than glass or porcelain, especially for the lawn or pool. Unfortunately, they create a huge amount of waste. Sustainable hotels are careful to use only high-quality, plastic-free materials. The energy-independent aparthotel OLM Nature Escape in Sand in Taufers, South Tyrol, uses only glass, porcelain, ceramic, clay and enamel for food and drink. Tablecloths and napkins Just as glass and porcelain are more stylish than plastic tableware, cloth napkins are more sophisticated than paper napkins. You can find them, for example, at the Relais del Maro in Liguria. The Albergo Diffuso in the picturesque village of Borgomaro takes care to avoid waste in all areas. Consequently, linen tablecloths are washed rather than thrown away. Towel change upon request only Since laundry does not produce waste, but does use detergent, water and energy, daily hotel laundry is another factor that you, as a guest, can help with. Many guests notice that even towels that have been hung up are all replaced the next day. This calls for well-trained staff who, like at the Lifestyle Resort Zum Kurfürsten on the Mosel, change towels only when requested. Even in the large wellness area with sauna and several pools, guests are asked to use sauna towels sparingly and sometimes several times. Forgoing daily room cleaning and turn-down service Similarly, as a guest, you can support a hotel’s sustainability efforts by choosing not to have your room cleaned daily. In most cases, you have to explicitly decline. For example, the sustainable Hotel Luise in Erlangen, Germany, tried to switch to opt-in (i.e., you get daily room cleaning only if you want it), but that would have meant being stripped of all their hotel stars by the Hotel Stars Union! However, at the ADLER Lodge RITTEN in South Tyrol (a luxurious all-inclusive resort close to nature), the turndown service has become an opt-in offer. This means that rooms are only prepared in the evening if you, the guest, specifically request it. No slippers The slippers provided in a hotel’s spa area are disposable products that generate huge amounts of waste. According to the German magazine Focus, the Steigenberger Hotels alone (a total of 60 hotels and resorts) would order 180,000 pairs of slippers for their guests each year. One can only imagine the mountain of slipper waste in the entire industry! The HUBERTUS Mountain Refugio Allgäu has therefore removed the slippers from the rooms and will only provide them upon request. Instead, guests are asked to bring their own. The romantic Hotel Das Rübezahl in Füssen, Germany, takes a similar approach to the slipper issue: guests are only provided with hotel slippers for the spa upon request, and the slippers are made of linen and cork, making them compostable. Backpack and shopping bag provided In many vacation destinations, plastic bags are still the norm. Even though a lot of plastic waste could be avoided! That is why CERVO Mountain Resort Zermatt in Switzerland provides guests with both a backpack for hiking and reusable bags for shopping. Digital Guest Magazine Digitization also reduces waste. Guests receive a digital reservation confirmation, there is a digital guest magazine and digital services. At the Eco-Hotel Okelmann’s, for example, you can download Komoot maps created by Senior Okelmann to your phone so you can start cycling right away. The Hotel Klosterbräu in Seefeld, Tyrol, has a guest channel on the hotel TV where you can find out about all the events and offers at the hotel. Offering waste separation for guests As mentioned at the beginning, many people use more disposable items on vacation than at home. Recycling is also often not as successful on vacation. However, this is not always the guests’ fault… You may have experienced the situation where there is only one disposable waste bin in the hotel room and you don’t even have the opportunity to separate your own waste. Some hotels may also think that their international guests don’t know how to it. Not so at Keemala on the island of Phuket in Thailand. “We have clearly marked recycling and waste stations throughout the resort, making it easy for guests to dispose of their waste properly,” they wrote to us. Unlike many internationally managed hotels on the island of Phuket, Keemala is owned by a local family who are very conscious of their impact on the environment. The 5-star ADLER Lodge RITTEN is another example of how in-room waste separation can be done in style. Toilet paper made out of Tetra Pak According to Statista, global per capita consumption of toilet paper reach almost 14 kilograms per person in 2023. However, in Germany, the figure is much higher, at 30.6 kilograms per person. A lot of trees have to be cut down to produce all this fresh fiber. The SCHWARZWALD PANORAMA in Bad Herrenalb has switched to toilet paper made from recycled beverage cartons. This reflects the concept of recycling that the wellness and selfness hotel also applies to its room furnishings. Wooden coffee pods eliminate single-use plastics Coffee capsule machines are definitely not the most sustainable way to make coffee. However, they are a great solution for allowing guests in a hotel suite to make their own coffee. The Birkenhof***** Spa and Genuss Resort uses Rezemo wooden coffee capsules. They contain coffee from sustainable sources. The other amenities of the 5-star wellness hotel are packaged in plastic-free cardboard as well. Zero-Waste Goodbye Gift When you leave, hotels often give you a small parting gift – and that too is a source of packaging waste. Of course, sustainable hotels have also thought about how to give you, the guest, a gift that is both beautiful and environmentally friendly. At the Naturhotel Outside in the Hohe Tauern National Park in East Tyrol, Austria, guests receive a jar of homemade jam in a reusable glass jar. The Hotel Weihrerhof in South Tyrol, on the Italian side of the Alps, offers soaps from its own organic cosmetics line, BergSea, which uses water from the Wolfsgruben Lake, located directly in front of the hotel. “We want our guests to take the soaps home with them and continue to dream of the Weihrerhof,” says the host family. As you can see, Green PearlsⓇ hotels have put a lot of thought into how they can eliminate single-use items, waste and plastic, which means you may use no more single-use items on your vacation than you would at home – in fact, you may use fewer items than at home!"
Sustainable Vacation Rentals and Eco Aparthotels,"The OLM Nature Escape in Sand in Taufers, which opened in 2022, is closely associated with Michelin-star cuisine. Chef Berni Aichner was for many years the sous-chef of 3-star chef Norbert Niederkofler. Like him, Aichner believes that exquisite taste can be achieved sustainably with 0-km-food. The best example of this is the “Pink Lady” risotto recipe with South Tyrolean ingredients. Harvested in November, the South Tyrolean “Pink Lady” apple is unmistakable for its pink color and sweet, crunchy flavor. It is the secret of this dish. The gourmet chef also uses local Traminer risotto rice, South Tyrolean Langrein wine, and South Tyrolean mountain cheese for his risotto recipe. South Tyrolean Risotto “Pink Lady” Ingredients Instructions Tip: If you want to make the recipe vegan, simply replace the knob of butter with a vegan alternative."
"Hiking in Germany, Austria and Switzerland","Skis on, out of the hotel and onto the slopes – a ski-in, ski-out hotel lets you start your day’s skiing right outside the hotel door, saving you the daily shuttle ride. But that’s not all that makes your ski vacation sustainable. We’ll show you what else to look for and introduce you to six sustainable accommodations right on the slopes. 5 ways to make your ski vacation more sustainable Skiing vacations have been criticized from a sustainability perspective due to the extensive infrastructure required. That’s why we’d like to start by briefly summarizing how you can minimize your carbon footprint on a ski vacation: Ski-in, ski-out hotels with guaranteed snow In the face of climate change, we recommend preparing to compromise and having a “Plan B” in case there is no snow during your booked trip, such as winter hiking or a cultural program. Alternatively, consider staying at ski hotels located in “snow-sure” areas, typically in the Alpine region above 1,200 meters. Is artificial snow an environmental issue? According to Statista, about 90 percent of all ski slopes in Italy have snowmaking systems. In Austria the figure is 70%, in Switzerland 53% and in Germany only 25%. Attitudes toward artificial snow vary widely across the Alpine region. Ski resorts that use artificial snow, such as Dolomiti Superski, argue that artificial snow is “just water”. When forced out of a small hole under high pressure, the cold turns it into snow. This process does not involve any chemicals. Water typically comes from specially constructed reservoirs and returns to the ground as the snow melts. So there are no problems? According to the WWF, there are. Artificial snow requires millions of gallons of water, energy and noise. The absence of trees on the slopes and the compacted ground from grading prevent the snow from being absorbed quickly when it melts, increasing the risk of landslides. The WWF ultimately demands a halt to the development of new ski resorts. It also criticizes hotel complexes as “real energy eaters”. This makes choosing a sustainable ski hotel all the more important. Sustainable ski-in, ski-out hotels in South Tyrol, Tyrol and Switzerland Here are five ski hotels that are right on the slopes and committed to sustainability. As an added bonus, there’s also a vacation home in Tyrol that’s not right on the slopes – but the ski bus stops right outside. #1 Paradiso Pure.Living Vegan Hotel | South Tyrol | Italy The Paradiso Pure.Living Vegan Hotel is located at an altitude of 2,020 meters on the Seiser Alm in the Dolomites. Due to its proximity to the UNESCO World Heritage Site, the hotel feels a special commitment to nature. It is unique in the region in its commitment to the vegan lifestyle. Food and beverages are 100 percent vegan, and as much as possible is organic and locally sourced. For example, you will find many creations with organic South Tyrolean apples, but also vegan pizza for lunch, vegan brownies in the afternoon, dumplings, pasta, herbs and vegetables – a fantastically creative and climate-friendly plant-based cuisine that you should try, even if you are not vegan! In addition to its magnificent location on two ski slopes, the hotel offers a spa area with several saunas and an outdoor saltwater hot tub. The hotel also promotes contemporary art with rotating exhibitions. Furthermore, it uses green electricity from Alperia, which is 90 percent hydroelectric. Ski Resort: The Paradiso Pure.Living Vegan Hotel is located in the Seiser Alm ski resort with 32 ski runs. However, the Seiser Alm is only one of twelve interconnected ski resorts, all of which are part of the Dolomiti Superski area. This means that with one ski pass you have 1,200 kilometers of slopes at your disposal! (For comparison, 200 kilometers or more of slopes is what you call a “big ski area”). Fortunately, Dolomiti Superski is also committed to sustainability, as detailed here on their website. However, the resort does use artificial snow. According to them, natural snow would not last the entire season, so they have to use artificial one. Sustainable travel: You can reach the Seiser Alm by train. From there the hotel will pick you up with a snow shuttle at a meeting point. #2 Hotel Bella Vista Zermatt | Switzerland Hotel Bella Vista Zermatt is a small, family-run hotel with only 21 rooms. The hotel has a view of the Matterhorn and is located above the center of Zermatt on 1620m. The Anthamatten family has managed the establishment for three generations. Hostess Fabienne Anthamatten is dedicated to zero-waste practices and has a keen interest in old wood and glacier melt. Her husband, Simon, is a mountain guide and helicopter pilot. Fabienne’s sister, Stefanie, a trained yoga teacher, also welcomes guests at the reception. Meanwhile, “Mama” Bernadette delights visitors with her homemade soups and jams. The Swiss hotel is not only family friendly, but also very cozy – with a stone pine parlor and fireplace in the lobby, as well as a small spa area with saunas. Ski area: The hotel is located below the Sunnegga – Rothorn valley station – so the valley run takes you directly to your hotel. Here you are connected to the Rothorn, Gornergrat Glacier and the Matterhorn Paradise ski area, which also includes Zermatt. Matterhorn Paradise is the highest ski area in the Alps (almost 4,000 meters in some places) and the largest summer ski area in Europe. It is open year round as many of the slopes are on glaciers. There are 360 km of slopes and you can even ski to Italy. Zermatt’s cable cars have been investing in sustainability for several years and are TourCert certified. Despite its glacier location, the slopes are regularly covered with artificial snow. Sustainable travel: Zermatt is car-free and accessible by train – as an added bonus, the hotel will even upgrade you to 1st class on the Visp-Zermatt route (for stays of 3 nights or more). Your luggage can be transported separately. A complimentary Hotel Bella Vista shuttle will pick you up at the train station. #3 CERVO Mountain Resort Zermatt | Switzerland The CERVO Mountain Resort, also located in the Swiss ski resort of Zermatt on the Matterhorn, is an exceptional ski-in, ski-out hotel. The sustainable resort consists of several buildings, restaurants and a spa area, and CERVO’s terraces are a popular spot for après-ski. The program includes numerous social events with live music, a group moonlight ski decent, movie night with fondue, etc. So this is the perfect place for you if you want to meet new people and enjoy some entertainment during your ski vacation. Ski area: The resort in Zermatt is also part of the aforementioned Matterhorn Paradise. Sustainable travel: You can also reach CERVO Mountain Resort by train via Zermatt station. Your ski pass can be ordered prior to your arrival and picked up at the reception desk. #4 Biohotel Grafenast | Tirol | Österreich If you are looking for a ski-in-ski-out hotel for a family ski vacation, we recommend the Biohotel Grafenast in Tyrol. The hotel is run by the Unterlechner family. Grandfather “Rodel-Toni” built a toboggan hut on the Pillberg in 1907, which still exists today. Situated at an altitude of 1,330 meters, you have a wonderful view of the valley. With only 23 rooms (some of which are family rooms with separate children’s rooms), the atmosphere is intimate. Organic food, environmental protection and nature are very important to the Unterlechners, which is why they cook only with organic products. Ski area: Biohotel Grafenast is located just 150 meters from the Kellerjoch ski area. The base station of the Kellerjochbahn, which takes you up to 1,890 meters, is just a few steps away. The small ski area has 20 km of slopes and 7 downhill runs, making it perfect for a (first) ski vacation with children. According to Snowtrex, about 30 percent of the slopes are covered with artificial snow. By the way, Café Rodel-Toni is located right next to the children’s ski school. Here parents can take a break while the kids learn to ski or play in the Kinderland. Sustainable travel: The closest train stations are Jenbach and Schwaz. For stays of three nights or more, half the taxi fare to the Biohotel will be reimbursed. #5 My Arbor | Südtirol | Italien If you are traveling without children and prefer the tranquility of an adults-only hotel, My Arbor may be just what you are looking for. Located near Brixen, it is an architectural highlight built on stilts in the middle of a spruce forest. The wellness hotel is located directly on the Plose Mountain. „After breakfast, I go to the ski room, put on my ski boots, grab my skis, and head straight from My Arbor to the Plose base station.“ – Alexandra Huber, My Arbor Ski area: The Plose ski area is particularly sunny and with 7 lifts and about 40 km of slopes ranging in altitude from 1,067 to 2,446 meters, quite modest. Its highlight is South Tyrol’s longest downhill run: 9 km. Sustainable travel: Brixen train station has direct connections from many major cities in Italy, Germany and Austria. Guests staying at My Arbor for 7 nights or more are picked up at the station free of charge. Otherwise, a taxi will cost approximately 30 euros for a 15-minute ride. #6 Summit Lodges Pfunds | Tyrol | Austria Finally, we would like to introduce you to two vacation homes that are not ski-in-ski-out, but have a ski bus stop right outside the door. The Summit Lodges Pfunds are American log cabin-style vacation homes that sleep up to six people and have their own sauna and wood-burning fireplace. With their own kitchens, you will be able to cook for yourself and plan your winter vacation at your own pace. Ski area: There are six ski resorts in the area and the ski bus stops just steps away from the apartments. A 20 minute drive will take you to the Tyrolean ski resort Nauders, which has 75 kilometers of slopes between 1,400 and 2,750 meters. The resort is snow sure, but artificial snow is still in use. If you take the ski bus a little further, you can also reach the Italian region of South Tyrol in about 35 minutes. Here at the Reschen Pass, there are 65 kilometers of slopes and 15 ski lifts around the Reschen Lake. Due to the altitude of 1,500 to 2,400 meters, it is considered snow-sure as well, but snow machines are still employed. Artificial snowmaking will continue to spread As you can see, even resorts that advertise sustainability cannot avoid the use of artificial snow. Particularly alarming is the fact that in the United States, slopes are already snowed with the addition of bacteria, a practice banned in Germany and Austria. The bacteria ensure that snow is produced even at low temperatures. Environmentalists fear that this could have unprecedented effects on the environment. But with global warming, it could be an attractive option for more ski resorts. In the future, a ski-in, ski-out vacation will only be possible through sustainability Skiing is far less sustainable than more gentle winter sports such as snowshoeing. All the more reason to consider some sustainability issues when going on a ski vacation. Ski-in-ski-out hotels are located in the heart of the resort, so you can experience nature – and its preparation – firsthand. As wonderful as this is, it should also be possible for future generations."

"Hiking in Germany, Austria and Switzerland","Glittering snow, the sight of snow-capped mountains, and the anticipation of the next run… Do these images come to mind when you think of a winter vacation? Then you feel the same way we do. But that means you probably also face the same challenge we do: Can you enjoy a ski vacation with a clear conscience in the face of the climate and energy crisis? And what do sustainable skiing holidays even look like? Winter Tourism and its Environmental Impact Every year, millions of winter sports enthusiasts travel to ski resorts around the world. In Europe, the Alps are the destination of choice. Of course, the same is true for hikers and bikers in spring, summer, and fall. However, skiing in particular is not without environmental consequences. At peak times, such as New Year’s Eve and the winter holidays, too many people descend on the valleys, the preparation of the slopes has a massive impact on the natural ecosystem, and off-piste skiing and night skiing disturb wildlife. Then there are the effects of man-made climate change. Warmer winters with less snow are causing problems, especially for low-lying resorts. Artificial Snow for Profit Snow cannons are often used to maintain the economic viability of ski resorts that depend on winter tourism. However, they have a serious impact on the environment. For one, they require a lot of water to produce artificial snow (which is often lacking in the surrounding natural environment): more than 4,700,000 liters per hectare can easily accumulate in a single season. In addition, artificial snow systems consume a lot of energy – the equivalent of 130,000 four-person households per year. On top of that, artificial snow has a different chemical composition than natural snow. It is less permeable to air, more compact, and less thermally insulating, which puts a strain on the soil and vegetation. The additional meltwater in spring is another problem. Sustainability and Skiing: Can they go Hand in Hand? After our brief summary, which really only shows a tiny part of the environmental impact of ski tourism, you may be wondering if a ski vacation can be sustainable at all. The short answer is no. You (we!) cannot have a fully sustainable ski vacation. Or any kind of travel for that matter. But what we can do is minimize the negative impacts and increase the positive ones. Because not everything about ski tourism is bad. Many regions are dependent on (ski) tourism. And even though most tourist regions in the Alps and in the mountains, in general, are trying harder to make the other seasons attractive for vacationers, winter tourism remains an important pillar on which livelihoods are built. We will now show you what eco-conscious skiing could look like, what you need to consider when planning and preparing your vacation, and which Green Pearls® partners offer the right accommodations. 7 Tips for a More Sustainable Ski Vacation 1. Avoid mass tourism and travel during low season. If you are not tied to school vacations, you can book your ski vacation off-season. Not only will you save a few dollars, but you will not be sharing the snowy mountains with as many people as you would during peak season. That’s not only better for your nerves, it’s also better for the environment. When many people crowd into (remote) resorts, it puts a lot of pressure on those areas. This is known as “overtourism“, which has particularly serious consequences for the fragile ecosystems of the Alps. 2. Make your journey eco-friendly. Getting to your winter vacation is easy by train. Many Green Pearls® partners have good public transport connections. If you’re driving, for example, because you don’t want to lug your equipment through the train, choose ski resorts that are close to you or as close as possible. For instance, Balderschwang in the Allgäu is among the most snow-sure regions in Germany, with up to twelve meters of snow per season. 3. Buy and maintain your ski equipment sustainably. You can and should consider sustainability when purchasing your equipment. If you only ski once a season or are not sure if you want to continue the hobby, simply rent the equipment locally. Or, if you prefer, at a sporting goods store near where you live. If you want to own your own equipment, check out the ski sales in your area. They usually take place in late fall and you can buy well-maintained, often one-season equipment for a fraction of the original price. If you ski a lot and want to buy new equipment, choose sustainable companies. Examples include Atomic, Vaude, and Stöckli. If you then have your skis and board waxed with environmentally friendly, petroleum-free wax, you can make another small contribution to protecting the environment. 4. Local transportation Once you arrive at your resort, you can usually just leave your car for the rest of your stay. Many resorts have ski buses that leave your accommodation and take you to the valley stations of the resorts. Or perhaps the first slopes and trails start right outside the hotel, as is the case at the Paradiso Pure.Living Vegan Hotel on the Seiser Alm, the HUBERTUS Mountain Refugio in Balderschwang in the Allgäu region, or at the Hotel Bella Vista in Zermatt, Switzerland. It’s best to check the local and logistical conditions in advance. 5. Protect plants and animals For some skiers, there is nothing more exciting than skiing on fresh snow. But it is not great for nature. To avoid endangering wildlife and protect plants, it is important to stay on groomed slopes, trails, and paths. In the long run, all winter sports enthusiasts will benefit more if these marked boundaries are respected. This also applies to hiking and other activities in the mountains. Winter or summer. 6. Book a sustainable accommodation If you want to be sure that your accommodation is doing all it can to make your vacation as sustainable and environmentally friendly as possible, then book with one of our Green Pearls® partners. They do their best every day to conserve resources, strengthen the region, and keep their environmental footprint as small as possible. This way you can enjoy your winter vacation without a guilty conscience. In addition to the hotels mentioned above, we highly recommend The Peak in Sölden and Summit Lodges Pfunds in the Tyrolean Oberland. At both, you can take off your slippers, put on your ski boots, and hit the slopes. 7. Choose sustainable ski destinations When choosing a ski resort, try to find one that uses little or no artificial snow. The use of renewable energy and monitoring visitor numbers to prevent overcrowding on the mountain are also part of a sustainable resort. In South Tyrol, for example, almost all resorts have invested in renewable energy generation from the sun and water to power the facilities. Ski trails are designed to minimize the impact on nature, and free ski buses connect towns and resorts. The climate-friendly resort of Carezza has even pledged to become carbon neutral by 2025. It already has intelligent control of its snow cannons, and the water it uses to make artificial snow comes from its own reservoirs, not the environment. If you are unsure about how the resort of your choice is addressing these issues, you can always check in advance with the local tourist office or lift operators. In the Alps, for example, 19 destinations have joined forces under the banner of “Alpine Pearls” to promote environmentally friendly tourism.  The destinations under the umbrella of this association focus on soft mobility in their diverse mobility offers. As a guest, you can travel through the region in an environmentally friendly way thanks to innovative and climate-friendly travel offers. The avoidance of artificially groomed slopes, the use of renewable energies, and the monitoring of visitor numbers in the mountains are further important and conscious measures taken by Alpine Pearls towards sustainable ski tourism. A more Sustainable Ski Vacation? It can be done! Even if we can never have a 100% sustainable ski vacation, we hope these tips have shown you that we can at least travel more sustainably.

Green Wedding: special places for a special day,"This summer (here in Germany) was totally inadequate. Do you agree? Do you want to enjoy the sun again before it turns into winter? Then you’re just like us! Not entirely unselfishly, we have selected seven warm destinations with sustainable accommodations for October and November, where you can count on sun and summer feelings! Sustainable vacation destinations near the equator As a rule of thumb, the closer you are to the equator (the imaginary line that runs through the center of the earth between the northern and southern hemispheres), the warmer it is. Because of the sun’s position, there are no seasons here, but it is always warm – around 90 degrees Fahrenheit (30 degrees Celsius). #1 The Maldives – 65 kilometers from the equator The Maldives, with over 1,100 islands south of India, look like they are right on the equator. The closest island, Gan, is actually only 65 kilometers away, while Malé is about 465 kilometers away. They lie in the northern hemisphere. Weather in Malé in October/November: In October and November you can expect a fairly constant temperature of around 90 °F (30 °C). October marks the end of the rainy season (May to October), with an average of two hours of rain per day during this month. Sustainable accommodation: At Gili Lankanfushi, you will stay in luxurious villas built on stilts over the water. The coral reefs and colorful fish life make the resort a diver’s paradise. The resort’s sustainable initiatives include a coral protection project, which you can visit with the resort’s marine biologist. #2 Indonesia – 555 km from the equator Indonesia consists of over 17,000 islands and is located in the Southern Hemisphere, about 555 kilometers from the equator. The most famous island is Bali, which is 935 kilometers away. The weather in Bali in October/November: Temperatures vary little and are around 88 °F (31 °C). The water temperature is 80,6 °F (27 °C). The rainy season starts in November. This means that it rains for one to two hours in the afternoon. Shorter showers of about 30 minutes are also possible in between. When it rains in Bali, you can follow the local trend of “yoga in the rain”, go scuba diving, or visit temples. Sustainable accommodation: Puri Dajuma Cottages & Spa is a beautiful resort with Balinese villas surrounded by tropical plants, a pool area, a fine sandy beach and direct access to the sea. The resort uses a variety of environmentally friendly measures and offers eco-tours that respect the culture and customs of the area. #3 Thailand (Phuket and Ko Phi Phi) – 860 kilometers north of the equator Thailand lies north of the equator, but not far from it. The island of Phuket is about 900 kilometers above the longest parallel, and the island of Koh Phi Phi is only 860 kilometers above it. In total, Thailand has over 500 islands, some of which are uninhabited. Weather on the Thai Islands in October/November: The temperature is fairly constant at around 86 °F (30 °C). October marks the end of the rainy season, although the rainy season means that it rains an average of 20 days a month with short, heavy showers. After that, the sun often shines, and since it is lush and green due to the abundance of rain, this is a great time to take beautiful landscape photos. November marks the beginning of the high tourist season. Sustainable accommodation in Phuket: An extraordinary resort awaits you in the treetops of the Enchanted Forest at Keemala. There is also a large garden with local fruits, vegetables and herbs used in the cooking classes. Sustainable accommodation on Koh Phi Phi Leh: Zeavola is a luxury dive resort offering PADI scuba diving courses. You stay in Thai-style bungalows surrounded by a true garden and forest paradise. Bird watchers will love it here. Excursion: How much does it rain at the equator and when is the best time to travel? The high levels of solar radiation at the equator throughout the year cause clouds to form and rain to fall. The “seasons” of the tropics are rainy seasons. There is a rainy season and a dry season. The common assumption that the dry season is the “good season” and the rainy season is the “bad season” is not true. By definition is the tropical rainy season But the rainy season can be cancelled. Or it can be stronger, weaker, earlier, later, shorter or longer than expected. (You know how it is with weather forecasts.) Holidays on the Canary Islands in October and November If you are looking for a vacation destination that is pleasantly warm (around 82,2°F (28°C)) and has many hours of sunshine in October and November, but not quite as far away as Thailand or Indonesia, then the Canary Islands are perfect. Generally it rains very little in the canaries – only a few days a year! Warm and dry Located off the northwest coast of Africa in the Atlantic Ocean, the Canary Islands are about 3,000 kilometers from the equator. Due to their geographical location and the Gulf Stream, it is warm and dry all year round. Let’s look at two islands as examples: Gran Canaria, perhaps the best known of the archipelago, and Tenerife, the largest. Weather in Gran Canaria in autumn: Gran Canaria is considered the warmest island in the fall. Even in November, the air temperature is usually between 73 ( 23°C) and 82 ( 28°C) and the water temperature is around 70 ( 20°C). Green PearlsⓇ Hotel on Gran Canaria: The small boutique hotel Casa León – Royal Retreat is located inland and is surrounded by 10,000 square meters of gardens with native plants. There is a daily (free) shuttle to the beach and you can enjoy a wonderful break here. Weather in Tenerife in October and November: “At this time of year you can spend the whole day outdoors, swimming in the sea and enjoying the gentle sun”, says the team of the OCÈANO Health Spa Hotel. In the fall, the temperature is between 62 and 70 °F (22 and 26 °C) and, as in Gran Canaria, the water temperature is around 80 °F (20 °C). Sustainable accommodation in Tenerife: The OCÈANO Health Spa Hotel is located in the north of the island, directly on the Atlantic Ocean. The large panoramic windows offer an uninterrupted view of the sea. The health hotel offers an extensive sports and nutrition program. Sicily: Hot summers, mild winters Another recommendation for a warm autumn vacation is Sicily. Sicily is the largest island in the Mediterranean and is located southwest of the Tip of the Boot. It is about 4,000 kilometers from the equator. Weather in Sicily in October and November: In late summer it is still warm (around 77°F (25°C)) and the water is still pleasant for swimming. You can also expect many hours of sunshine. However, it rains more often during this time (expect about 8 days of rain per month). Sustainable hotel in Sicily: The ADLER Spa Resort SICILIA will open in the summer of 2022 and is a beautiful, luxurious resort located directly on a natural beach protected by the WWF and accessible only from the resort. Traveling in times of climate change As you probably already know, global warming doesn’t just mean that it’s warming up a degree, it means that ecosystems around the world, from coral reefs to mountain glaciers, are being disrupted. The consequences are even more extreme. 2023 has been dubbed the “year of climate records” by Geo. In 2024 we had floods in Germany and a heat wave in Southern Europe with extreme temperatures of over 40 degrees (June 2024 was the hottest month in Greece in 164 years of weather records). In Brazil, people died from heavy rains, and in Mexico, water became so scarce from drought that the population, industry, politics, and farmers were drawn into serious conflicts. The equatorial weather zone will shift Also interesting (and alarming!) is that climate change will also cause climate zones to shift. At least that’s what researchers in California think. In their study, they predict that the equatorial rain belt will shift north over the Indian Ocean (Asia) and south over the Atlantic Ocean (South America). This could lead to increased flooding in southern India and drought stress in Central America. To avoid further global warming, we must all work to reduce man-made greenhouse gases. Most of this concerns energy consumption and industry, but the tourism industry also needs to rethink. We addressed this issue in our blog post ” Are we still allowed to fly? However, because sustainability is not just about carbon footprints, but also about social sustainability, for example in tourism, we believe that travel – even to far-flung destinations – remains important. Balancing act We hope that our little essay on climate and the destinations presented here has helped you plan your trip. By the way, being concerned about climate change and sustainability doesn’t mean you can’t plan your vacation based on where it’s “nice” at the moment. But it should encourage us all to make climate-conscious choices when traveling and to support accommodations that have already recognized this. Still looking for inspiration for your fall vacation in the South? Then save this post to your Pinterest board!"
Eco-friendly sunscreen: what does sun protection have to do with corals?,"Soft white beaches, crystal clear water and all kinds of colorful fish: the Maldives are a paradise for nature lovers. But the islands are threatened by environmental damage and rising sea levels. But simply avoiding the popular vacation destination will not solve the problem – tourism not only provides a livelihood for the majority of the island’s inhabitants, it also helps fund preservation projects. Here we introduce you to the Maldives and show you what a sustainable vacation in the Maldives can look like. In addition, we will introduce you to Gili Lankanfushi Eco Resort and other sustainable initiatives and projects. The Maldives are in danger! The Maldives consists of 26 atolls with nearly 1,200 coral islands. The capital, Male, one of the highest points in the archipelago, is only 2.40 meters above sea level. The islands are threatened for several reasons: As you can see, the problems of the Maldives are closely linked to climate change. So the most important thing you can do for the Maldives (even from home) is to live a generally sustainable life, keep your carbon footprint low, avoid waste and plastic, and support climate-friendly policies and projects. Can a holiday in the Maldives be sustainable? This question is probably asked by everyone who thinks about a trip to the Maldives. A long-haul flight to the islands in the Indian Ocean is an ecological problem. According to the German Federal Environment Agency, a flight from Germany to the Maldives and back has a “climate impact of about three tons of CO2 equivalents”. (This is the equivalent of driving a mid-range car about 15,000 kilometers). Nevertheless, we believe that travel to the Maldives should not be demonized. Tourism is very important for the country. It is the main source of income. According to GIZ, the Maldives receives 90 percent of all tax and customs revenue from tourism. The money helps to clean the beaches of marine debris, build sea walls, promote renewable energy, etc. Therefore, not traveling to the Maldives, or even banning travel to the Maldives, is not the answer. Instead, we advocate making a conscious decision to travel to the Maldives, addressing your impact as a tourist, and making your trip sustainable. We will show you how to do this using Gili Lankanfushi as an example. Sustainable Maldives Vacation at Gili Lankanfushi The sustainable luxury resort of Gili Lankanfushi consists of 45 eco-villas on the water and is committed to environmental protection (no disposable products, economical use of water and electricity) as well as social projects. These include purchasing local products, training staff, and supporting a school. Maldives: A strong commitment to marine life In addition to this commitment to everyday hotel life, there are many exciting environmental projects initiated and supported by the hotel. With Gili Veshi, Gili Lankanfushi has opened a marine biology center that promotes research and gives you the opportunity to get involved: Here you can participate in monthly coral reef clean-ups, help with seagrass planting, or assist with coral colonization. If you want to learn more about Gili Lankanfushi’s sustainable diving projects, we already wrote about them on this blog article about sustainable diving vacation. Close encounters with the greats of the sea A special feature of the Maldives: With a bit of luck, even snorkelers can get close to whale sharks – at up to 13 meters in length, they are the largest sharks in the world – or be surrounded by majestic manta rays. One of the most famous sighting spots is Hanifaru Bay in Baa Atoll. During the western monsoon from May to November, plankton collects in the funnel-shaped lagoon and magically attracts the animals. Up to 200 manta rays and 20 whale sharks have been spotted here simultaneously! To protect the animals, resorts and dive centers in Baa Atoll have joined forces with the NGO BAARU, which sorts and disposes of marine debris. Sustainable vacations in the Maldives: take action for the corals yourself Without coral, the Maldives would not exist, as the islands are part of atolls, ring-shaped coral reefs. Only healthy reefs can help counteract the effects of rising sea levels and the sinking of islands into the sea. However, the effects of climate change and heavy pollution have already destroyed a large part of the reefs. As a result, some resorts are working on specific projects to help corals recover. At Gili Lankanfushi, you can watch marine biologists grow new corals and learn about these special creatures at regular lectures. As a scuba diver, you can also get involved underwater, for example by cleaning the Coral Lines. Get to know the country and its people Most travelers do not know how people live in the Maldives. This is not due to the ignorance of the diving and swimming tourists (as one might think), but is a political decision. Since the Islamic country opened up to tourism in 1972, a clear distinction has been made between islands for tourists and islands for locals. Contrary to what is often assumed in the West, Islam itself is a very tolerant religion. The motto is “Lakum Dinakum, wa lia Din” (for you your religion/way of life, for us our religion/way of life). This means that you can enter the Maldives as an unmarried couple, sunbathe in a bikini, drink alcohol, etc. Originally, tourists were not allowed on native islands, and natives were not allowed on tourist islands, except as workers. This has since been liberalized. Gili Lankanfushi is located in the North Malé Atoll. If you want to meet the locals, you can either go to the capital Male or take a boat trip to Dhiffuhi Island. About 1,000 people live here. There are three mosques, two schools, shops, cafes, a hospital, farming and fishing. Alcohol is forbidden here and although there is no legal dress code, you should dress more modestly out of respect (Men: shorts up to the knees, women: shoulders, neckline and knees covered). A sustainable vacation in the Maldives is not just a nice-to-have Luxury, palm trees, white beaches and a turquoise sea are the hallmarks of the Maldives. But this image is being threatened by unscrupulous tourism and reckless travel decisions. Sustainable travel to the Maldives (and other island paradises) is an absolute must. So if you decide to travel to the Maldives, plan a longer stay and get involved in a country that definitely has too much to offer for you to just visit the beach in front of your hotel 😉 .

Green Wedding: special places for a special day,"The sound of the ocean, an endless horizon, the surface of the water glistening in the sun, and fine, soft sand under your feet… There is something special about sandy beaches, and we all understand, why they belong to the most popular vacation destinations. But did you know that sand is a finite resource and that entire stretches of coastline are already depleted? Learn about the state of our beaches, the importance of a sustainable beach vacation, and what it looks like. Sand – Our most important resource after water Like the sand of the sea. Meaning: infinitely available. But this general saying is no longer true. Sand is the most used resource in the world (after water). This is due to concrete – a mixture of cement with sand/gravel and water. It has been the most widely used building material since the 19th century, especially in urban construction. As we reported in this blog post about villages in motion, more and more people are moving to cities, and the construction boom there is consuming huge amounts of concrete, both for buildings and infrastructure. Using sand, Singapore added landmass The biggest consumers of sand today are Asia’s booming economies. Singapore, for example, has dumped 500 million tons into the sea to gain land. According to Deutschlandfunk, the sand came from Indonesia, Cambodia, Malaysia, and Thailand. By sucking the sand from the seabed, 24 sand islands in Indonesia sank. In response, Indonesia, Cambodia, and Malaysia have already banned the export of their sand. Experts expect Africa to follow suit in the coming years. With rapidly growing populations, cities will expand and grow explosively. Sand theft for luxury resorts? In 2008, a sand heist in Jamaica made headlines when 500 truckloads of the finest sand were stolen overnight from a fishing village. It will take several hundred years for that beach – and the local habitat – to regenerate. The theft was a disaster for the local ecosystem. The case was never solved, but the fine sand was probably sold to luxury resorts for their beaches. There have also been several reports of sand robbery around Lake Victoria in East Africa. This shows that the resource is not only freely available in abundance but also valuable and desirable. 1.   Rule: You must come to the beach, not the beach to you! Don’t support hotels that have a fine sandy beach right outside while the rest of the coast is rocky or pebbly. Sure, there are some natural sandy beaches among rocks, but always ask yourself if that is the case here. Purchased sandy beaches come from a different ecosystem and are missing there! Moreover, the artificial transport of sand to the coast is not ecological. So, either accept the rocky beach and enjoy the rugged landscape, or find a destination where the beach is as natural as you want it to be. Sustainable eco-hotels on dream beaches At Green PearlsⓇ you’ll find some green pearls that are located right on beautiful beaches and are also committed to sustainability. Here is a brief look at six of them: #1: ADLER Spa Resort SICILIA – Protected beach The six-kilometer-long beach in front of the ADLER Spa Resort SICILIA is a WWF protected area and one of the most beautiful beaches in Sicily. Since the beach of the “Riserva Naturale Torre Salsa” is lined with dunes and cliffs, you will hardly find any tourists except for the guests of the resort. The staff works with the WWF to preserve biodiversity and the local ecosystem, and regularly cleans the beach of washed-up plastic. Experience a protected and well-kept beach in southern Italy. #2 Cerf Island Resort in the Seychelles – Dream Beach on a Water Reserve Cerf Island is only 1.5 km long and 1 km wide. So, you are amidst pure sandy beaches. And there’s more. The crystal clear waters with its colorful underwater world and mangrove trees are part of the Saint-Anne National Marine Park. Guided tours through the National Marine Park – either above the water on kayak tours or underwater with diving and snorkeling – will teach you a lot about life in the Indian Ocean. #3 Puri Dajuma – Eco-resort with private beach in Bali Bali is famous for its white dream beaches, tropical nature and magical atmosphere. Puri Dajuma is an eco-resort that focuses on waste reduction, social responsibility, and sustainable tourism. Stay in small, luxurious Balinese-style cottages on a private, picture-postcard beach. Tip: Before you pack your bags and travel to Bali, we recommend you to read our article about Bali and its dark side. For example, a local tells you what tourists often do wrong in Bali. #4 Zeavola – Barefoot in luxury on Koh Phi Phi Leh in Thailand Barefoot in luxury is the lifestyle you can enjoy at Zeavola. Stay in naturally designed villas and drift between beach, culinary delights, and spa – always feeling the sand beneath your feet. Located on the Thai island of Koh Phi Phi Leh, the resort also offers PADI scuba diving courses, where experienced guides introduce you to the beautiful underwater world of coral reefs. #5 Gili Lankanfushi – Fine sand, palms and corals At Gili Lankanfushi, rooms are not on the beach overlooking the ocean – they are on the ocean overlooking the beach! As the lowest country in the world, the Maldives are the most affected by rising sea levels. You can read more about this in our blog on endangered islands. This makes it all the more important to focus on sustainable tourism and choose an eco-friendly resort, like Gili Lankanfushi. #6 Lifestylehotel SAND at the Baltic Sea Beach The Lifestylehotel SAND is located in the second row of the German Baltic Sea beach in Timmendorfer Strand. As the Baltic Sea can be quite windy, it’s best to book a typical wicker beach chair on the beach. That way you only have the sand under your feet and not everywhere else. As the name of the hotel suggests, the sand of the Baltic Sea beach is a source of inspiration for the sustainable and natural design of the hotel. 9 Tips for a sustainable beach vacation Vacation by the sea – without a sandy beach Not every coast has a sandy beach. And ecologically speaking, it would be completely wrong for tourists to expect sandy beaches everywhere – and thus indirectly contribute to sand depletion (keyword: supply and demand). However, many countries have found ways to make even steep coastlines attractive. “Here in Tenerife, the “piscinas naturales” are widespread and very popular with both guests and locals,” says the OCÉANO Health Spa Hotel. “They are sheltered pools in the sea that fill with natural seawater. One is right in front of the OCÉANO”. We hope we have given you some good tips for your next beach vacation and helped you appreciate (and protect) the natural wonder that is sand). PS: People are already thinking about how to build when the sand really runs out. Recycled concrete is the answer. Unfortunately, there is still little interest in the industry. Our prediction: As long as politicians do not pass laws and force the industry to do so, nothing will happen in the area of sand conservation. This makes it all the more important to support sustainability and resource conservation wherever we can. Save this article for your next beach vacation."
Green Wedding: special places for a special day,"The island – a dropout’s place of longing. At least that’s how the often-quoted phrase “I’m ready for the island”, sung by Peter Cornelius in his 1981 hit, came about. Islands fascinate us. Far away from everything. Needing to cross the sea for anyone to reach you. Ideal for getting away from daily stress and responsibilities. However, sea levels are rising and many island paradises are likely to disappear in the coming decades. All the more reason why we as travelers shouldn’t rush to plan our next island getaway before it’s no longer possible. Instead, now is the time to take a hard look at what island vacations mean to our planet and how we can make them sustainable. Islands in peril: sea level rise and climate change The latest report from the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) focuses extensively on rising sea levels (GMSL = global mean sea level). It is caused by melting glaciers as a result of rising temperatures. (By the way, we discussed melting glaciers last week in this blog post.) Sea levels are already higher than they were in pre-industrial times. So, the question is not if, but how much the seas will rise? According to the ICPP report: “GMSL will rise between 0.43 m (0.29–0.59 m) and 0.84 m (0.61–1.10 m) by 2100”. However, experts also acknowledge that uncertainties in climate change-induced sea level rise increase significantly after 2050 due to uncertainties in emission scenarios. Studies show that a GMSL of 2m by 2100 cannot be ruled out. The Maldives and Other Endangered Islands The Maldives is the lowest country in the world. It consists of 26 atolls and over 1,000 coral islands in the middle of the Indian Ocean. According to Planet Wissen, their highest elevation is only 2.40 meters. If the sea level rises by 2 meters, the descendants of today’s Maldivians will have no land to live on. But water levels are not the only climate-related issue facing the Maldives: Tourism in the Maldives – Helping or adding to the problems? Tourists produce waste, and the buildings created for them often have a strong impact on nature. For example, in the name of “landscaping,” some islands are altered to better suit the hotel complex. Sand is piled up and reefs are dredged. The long-term impact on the local ecosystem (ocean currents, flora and fauna) is often unclear or ignored in such projects Nevertheless, tourism is vital to the Maldives as it is the main source of income. According to GIZ, the Maldives derives 90% of its tax and customs revenue from tourism. Sustainable tourism in Gilli Lankanfushi To ensure that tourism not only benefits the economy but also preserves nature, we believe it is essential to focus on sustainable tourism. Fortunately, more and more players in the industry see it that way – including those in the Maldives. We are pleased to introduce you to Gili Lankanfushi Resort, a sustainable Green Pearls® partner in the Maldives. The eco-luxury resort consists of 45 waterfront villas and is committed to protecting the environment in many ways. These efforts include eliminating plastic wherever possible, conserving water and energy, and sourcing local food. Gili Lankanfushi is also committed to its Maldivian employees (training and bus service) and the local school. The island-saving importance of coral reefs One hope for islands like the Maldives are their coral reefs. These reefs have the ability to grow with a slight rise in sea level. Furthermore, they act as breakwaters. The 2004 tsunami showed that where intact reefs and mangrove belts were present as a protective barrier, the devastation of the tidal wave was least severe. But the coral reefs themselves are at risk Their enemies include: You may have heard of coral bleaching. This phenomenon occurs when corals lose their color because they repel the different colored algae with which they actually form a community. It occurs when water temperatures get too high. Bleached corals do not necessarily die but are capable of regenerating when their environment returns to normal. Scientific research has shown this in the Great Barrier Reef (Australia). However, if the elevated water temperature persists, the corals will die. Speaking to Geo, coral researcher Professor Christian Voolstra says that global warming of 1.5C could kill around 70-90% of reefs. However, there is hope that corals may be able to adapt to higher temperatures. Currently, coral reefs have at least the strength to regenerate after being destroyed. Corals on Ko Phi Phi Leh recovered from mass tourism 90% of the coral off the Thai island of Ko Phi Phi Leh were damaged in 2018. Not because of climate change, but because of us tourists. The trigger was the Hollywood movie “The Beach”, in which the dropout Richard (played by Leonardo DiCaprio) finds his paradise – in “Maya Bay” on Ko Phi Phi Leh. As a result, the bay was closed to visitors in 2018. And after only 4 years (2022) many corals had recovered and reef sharks had returned. Zeavola Resort on Ko Phi Phi Leh supports reef development Ko Phi Phi Leh is about an hour’s speedboat ride from Phuket and is indeed a dreamy mix of fine white sand, tropical vegetation and turquoise waters. Our Green PearlsⓇ partner, Zeavola Resort, is committed to sustainable tourism and coral reef conservation. Over 10,000 coral fragments have already been replanted by Zeavola. In addition, the staff regularly cleans the beach and reefs of marine debris. The luxurious resort offers PADI scuba diving courses and the opportunity to experience the underwater world of the coral reefs for yourself. Trained divers (as opposed to party tourists) are generally not a threat to the reefs, but rather those who are committed to protecting nature. Is Phuket still an island? Some time ago we had a lively discussion in our team about whether Phuket is still an island when there are two car bridges connecting it to the mainland. Our final verdict: Yes, Phuket is still an island because the land is surrounded by sea – a car bridge doesn’t count! (Or do you disagree?) Sustainable holiday at Keemala in Phuket. The fact that islands are completely surrounded by water means that they are often more difficult to supply and many products have to be imported. Keemala “Villa Wonderland” in Phuket has created a large self-catering garden with fruits, vegetables, and herbs for the hotel kitchen. The resort’s cooking classes include a tour of the Thai plants. In addition, Keemala is part of the zero-waste movement and does not use single-use plastics throughout the resort. Canary Islands – Europe in front of Africa The Canary Islands are politically part of Spain and geographically part of Africa – they lie off the west coast of Africa. The islands have a mild and warm climate, beautiful beaches with bizarre rock formations, and a unique flora and fauna with many endemic plants and animals (which you can only find here). These include the Canary Island striped gecko. There are 8 Canary Islands: It is impossible to say which one is “the most beautiful”. They each have their own charm! How climate change threatens the Canary Islands In 2023, the Ministry of the Environment of the Canary Islands called for a forward-looking policy. The Teide National Park in Tenerife already shows signs of the consequences of climate change. Speaking at the 2023 Environment Forum in Gran Canaria, Environment Minister José Antonio Valbuena warned of the following developments due to climate change: Water and climate projects of Casa León Royal Retreat in Gran Canaria Fresh water is already scarce in the Canary Islands. Gran Canaria’s climate is also dry and there are no rivers or lakes. “Getting water is a vital problem,” reports Green PearlsⓇ Hotel Casa León Royal Retreat. The small 25-room boutique hotel is located in the interior of Gran Canaria. A 10,000-square-foot garden has been planted on the property with native, drought-resistant plants such as cacti, which naturally require little water. In addition, there is a rainwater harvesting system and a water treatment plant for potable water. Small signs in the bathrooms remind guests to conserve water and not to wash towels unnecessarily. In a further commitment to the global climate, the owner family has leased 40,000 hectares of forest in the Balkans. Sustainable vacation at the OCÉANO Health Spa Hotel in Tenerife On the Canary Island of Tenerife, the operators of the OCÉANO Health Spa Hotel are also committed to sustainability. The hotel uses filtered gray water from a local initiative to irrigate the grounds and flush the toilets. Local products are available, and for each guest who books through the Océano website, a tree is planted through the mountain forest project partner. Find out more about vacationing in Tenerife in this travel report. Getting to Sicily by train You don’t have to fly to the Italian island of Sicily. There is – get this – a train service to the island! The train rolls at Villa San Giovanni on a ferry and goes in Messina in Sicily back on the rail! However, public transportation on the island is very poorly developed. Most vacationers therefore rent a car locally. There is definitely a lot of work to be done in terms of transport sustainability. Our Green Pearls® partner, the ADLER Spa Resort SICILIA on the protected natural beach, is committed to sustainability. For an authentic experience of Sicily, the resort offers a “Village Experience”. You will visit the picturesque village of Catabellotta and learn about its thousand-year history. As a special, you have a tasting of the local Biancolilla olives and lunch at the home of a local family. Tips for a sustainable island getaway To conclude, let’s summarize how you can sustainably travel to the islands and what you can do to protect them: Can you think of other measures? Let us know in the comments. And at the end, let’s sing together: “I’m ready to protect the islands!” 🙂 Save the article for your next travel plans!"
Green Wedding: special places for a special day,"The Fascination of Diving We are as alien underwater as we are in space, and as dependent on technical assistance. Moving in slow motion, we are virtually weightless. Almost space-like. Under water, sound, language, and time are essentially meaningless. A diver rarely measures time in minutes. The dive is limited by the amount of oxygen you have left. (And the depth to which you descend, but that would be going too far :D) As a diver, you are entering a habitat in which you do not belong. The fish around you, the plants, the marine mammals – they belong here, but we divers are guests in this environment. We are allowed to observe, sometimes even be a small part of it, and we are observed. It is always fascinating to see how the marine life is either unaffected by our presence or curiously watching. These encounters and “guest awareness” are the reasons why sustainability and marine conservation are ingrained in the mentality of most divers. As guests in the underwater world, we can witness first-hand what pollution and the like are doing to this unique habitat. The amount of dirt and garbage we sometimes bring ashore on our dives… Sometimes you really wonder if people see the sea as a dumpster when you pull up tin cans, fishing lines and hooks, glass, or whole plastic posters from the seabed. Excursion: Diving Safety By the way, I write “we” mainly because as a diver you never dive alone. You are always accompanied by one or two buddies who can help in case of an emergency. As mentioned in the beginning, we are dependent on technical assistance underwater. If something goes wrong, it is essential that someone is there with their equipment to take over until you return to the surface. Training, Diving, and Sustainability Most of us don’t get into diving to clean up the world’s oceans and lakes. For me, I started out of pure curiosity. And because I wanted to watch fish. For most people, it’s the fascination of life underwater and the slowness and silence that envelops you as soon as you go underwater that drives them to the nearest diving club. Often on vacation, to explore the foreign underwater world with its colorful fish more closely than by snorkeling. Let’s leave aside the question of whether a three-day course qualifies as training. I’m glad I had more time to gain confidence in my equipment and skills. Diving requirements In general, almost anyone can start scuba diving. Usually there is a lower age limit (usually from 10 years), but there are hardly any upper limits. The only requirement is a certain level of basic fitness. But before you get your scuba license, you need to see a diving or sports physician for a physical examination anyway. I didn’t train in the warm south with crystal clear water but in the Baltic Sea. Sometimes with water temperatures of 9 degrees Celsius and visibility of just under two meters. Sometimes less. You can also earn your diving license in lakes. Respect for the sea, nature, and underwater creatures was taught to us from the very beginning by our instructors (and this happens in most diving resorts and vacation courses as well). Both underwater and on the surface. For example, the handling of corals and how to behave towards them is firmly anchored in the diving training. First of all, you should not touch them with your bare hands. Excursion: Diving in the Tropics Some time ago we had a discussion in the editorial office about the careless or disrespectful behavior of tourists and the resulting destruction of reefs. Divers were also mentioned, and although there are certainly black sheep in the diving community, I would like to put my hand in the fire for the majority of passionate divers and say: They know how to behave underwater so as not to destroy or damage anything. On the contrary. They are the ones who bring back the plastic bags and flip-flops that others have “lost” … Diving while Traveling: Does it always have to be tropical waters? Now that we are on the topic of the tropics with their brightly colored fish and corals, the question inevitably arises: Do you always have to dive in the tropics? No, of course not! I haven’t been there either. Instead, I’ve been observing life in the Baltic Sea. Did you know that there are little blue starfish in the Baltic Sea? Or how beautiful fire jellyfish can look in refracted sunlight underwater (and from far away!)? However, there are a few more distant destinations on my personal bucket list. You can read about how to ensure the sustainability of such a trip in our article “Scuba Diving in the tropics” (there are also other tips for diving destinations!). Diving in the Baltic Sea – Recommended Accommodation If you want to experience the Baltic Sea through diving, there are numerous locations along the entire coast. For example Timmendorfer Strand! Barely two minutes from the beach lies the sustainable Lifestylehotel SAND, which works with the WDC (Whale and Dolphin Conservation). The WWF also offers snorkeling tours in the area! Perfect for those who don’t have a diving license (yet)! Sustainable Engagement under the Sea When it comes to marine conservation, I think we divers are very prone to greenwashing. Whenever we find an opportunity to give something back to the ocean as a thank you for the wonderful time we regularly spend there, we take it. However, as always, not everything is as green as it looks. For example, coral planting projects are often criticized because they are not always done by experts, the coral pieces are taken from living coral, or no attention is paid to biodiversity and genetic diversity in the plantings. Especially in the latter case, the fragile corals are likely to die in the next disaster. Researchers say it makes more sense to protect existing reefs and mitigate climate change. That’s why it’s better to clean and restore reefs than to plant coral 😉 Some resorts, such as Gili Lankanfushi in the Maldives, offer courses where you can help marine biologists with their work. This way you can be relatively sure that you are not falling for greenwashing, but doing real conservation. The Gili also offers conservation lectures and training for dive instructors. Read this article to learn more about how and why you should make your diving vacation sustainable! Sustainability in Diving Associations In the Baltic Sea, diving as a relaxing and fascinating hobby and practical conservation can go hand in hand. Whether it’s retrieving ghost nets or collecting and disposing of fishing hooks and plastic bags on land. 5 tips for Sustainable Diving If you are now in the mood to share this hobby with me, here is a summary of my tips for getting you started: And last but not least: Have fun underwater! Diving is fascinating, but it’s the experience, the community and the commitment to nature that make it truly special! Ever been diving? Then share your experiences in the comments!

"Hiking in Germany, Austria and Switzerland","After we took you on a journey through Switzerland and Italy on Tuesday, we dedicate the blog post today to the most beautiful, sustainable and dog-friendly vacation destinations in Germany and Austria. And for the vacationers among you who are traveling outside of Europe, there are also a few more exotic destinations. Nevertheless, let’s start in the Austrian mountains (Here you can find everything, you should know about cacationing in Austria). In Sölden  two beautiful, sustainable and pet-friendly destinations await you: LENI MOUNTAIN Apartments & Chalet and The Peak Sölden. More than just winter sports Sölden is impressive for its picturesque and prominent location. While the place is mainly known for winter sports and its après-ski parties, you can also go on great hikes with your four-legged friend. In the apartments you have comfortable space for your dog and in the kitchen, you can prepare your food of choice. For fresh air we recommend the wide network of hiking and biking trails. Your reward for the steeper sections? Breathtaking views over the Alps! Picturesque mountain lakes or rest stops at lofty heights are perfect for a great break — or for you and your dog to splash around. A dog-friendly oasis of peace Are you feeling stressed? Then the next hotel is a good choice! Just before the German border lies Leutasch. Here you find the Naturhotel Aufatmen, an oasis of peace. The rooms provide for a comfortable stay with your dog. The Aufatmen is a pure vegetarian hotel, which also has a large selection of vegan dishes. Perfect for hiking or just to relax. Carefree-Package for you and your dog If you are looking for an all-round carefree package for your furry friend, you are in good hands at the HUBERTUS Mountain Refugio Allgäu. Your dogs are most welcomed. The package of the Allgäu hotel includes a food and water bowl, dry food from Happy Dog, a dog blanket, a dog bathrobe and even a dog drinking bottle for hiking. Sounds great already, right? The nature around Balderschwang is also a dog paradise, especially the Nagelfluh Nature Park, where the HUBERTUS is located. Your furry friend is not allowed in the restaurant, but on request a table can be set up for you and your four-legged friend in the TeeStube (that’s in the lobby area) for breakfast, lunch, and dinner. Dog-friendly fun in the water Do you prefer a vacation by the water? Then visit the MANOAH houses. With the nearby beach house Da Rosario, the Bio-Seehotel Zeulenroda as well as the Pâtisserie Bergmann, the Zeulenrodaer Meer offers excursion destinations and culinary delights at the same time. Directly in the vacation home complex, an exclusive 24-hour market is ready for you — if you or your darling get hungry, you will always find a snack here. Circular paths like the “Staudammblick” lead you along the shore of the Zeulenroda Sea. On the way you will get an impression of the dams, you can enjoy the wide view of the countryside and the town of Zeulenroda-Triebes and you have many opportunities to rest or take a break. Exciting forest for curious noses No lake at the Naturresort Schindelbruch, but forests as far as the eye can see — which is also super exciting for your dog. The resort is happy to welcome dogs. Here, a water and food bowl are provided so that you can start your vacation completely relaxed (and with less luggage). Even a cuddly sleeping place will be prepared for your darlings, if you wish so. As a special bonus, there are some treats for your four-legged friend. Souvenirs for your favorite fur-friend Do you have a water rat who also likes to rummage in the forest? Then you should check out Okelmann’s. Dogs are allowed everywhere on a leash — except in the sauna area 😉. Especially the rooms with terrace and garden access are ideal. Outside it is wonderful to romp and walk in the large lawn, the forest or garden. The welcome package for four-legged friends includes welcome treats, bowls and a dog blanket are available on loan. And if the treats have tasted particularly good to your dog, you can buy them in the hotel’s own concept store. And as a special souvenir: Grab a few dog accessories. But it’s not just in the middle of Europe that you’ll find beautiful, sustainable and pet-friendly hotels. The Maslina Resort in Croatia is also happy to welcome you and your four-legged friend. Here you can enjoy the warm weather together and explore the stunningly beautiful beaches. Let’s hop across the globe: the Puri Dajuma in Indonesia and the Kasbah du Toubkal in Morocco are both pet-friendly hotels, too. Hike in the Atlas Mountains or relax on the beach in Indonesia: You can also spend great vacations here. However, you should spare your pet the long journey if you come from Europe.

The 5 most beautiful eco-luxury hotels in the Alps,"Many Green Pearls®’ partners support or initiate projects to ensure sustainable development in their region. This involves various topics such as environmental and animal protection, recycling projects, support for communities, and education and training of local people. At several Green Pearls® hotels, you can support these local projects, using your trip to raise awareness about important sustainability issues. Coral Lines Project – Planting corals at Gili Lankanfushi At Gili Lankanfushi in the Maldives, marine biologists have initiated a project to help regenerate coral reefs. The resort is a pioneer in sustainability in the Maldives. In this project, 50 coral fragments are tied to a rope and then left to grow on the seabed for at least a year. The next step is to transplant the corals grown to the house reef. If you feel like it, you are invited to join the marine biologists in connecting the corals to the rope. Each rope has an ID number and you can follow the growth of “your” coral lines every three months on the project blog. Rescue dogs and cats at Tongsai Bay The Tongsai Bay has been sustainably oriented since its beginning. Environmental protection and social action determine the philosophy of the owners. The resort supports the regional animal shelter with equipment and food and has also donated a minibus that is often in use. If you feel like adopting a dog or cat, you can choose one to become a sponsor. The sponsorship costs 20 euros per month. There are also German accounts to which donations can be transferred, as well as a receipt for the donation. Kasbah du Toubkal and education for all In many Moroccan rural regions, girls are denied schooling. This is also due to the lack of infrastructure. Schools are too far away and accommodation near the school is financially unaffordable for families. In order to help here, our partner hotel in Morocco, the Kasbah du Toubkal, has co-founded the initiative “Education for all” to enable precisely these girls to receive a school education. They receive free accommodation in the school’s own hostels near the school and can participate in education and thereby sustainably improve their standard of living in rural areas. According to the motto “Educate a boy and you educate the man; educate a girl and you educate a family, a community, a nation”, “Education for All” is committed to the school education of disadvantaged girls. The project is financed and made possible by the guests of the Kasbah du Toubkal, donations, and volunteers. They help the girls with their schoolwork and also teach French. Maybe you would like to apply as a volunteer. You can do so at info@efamorocco.org. Happy chickens at Berghotel Rehlegg Would you like to visit happy chickens? You can do that at the partner farm of Berghotel Rehlegg. Here at Haus Hohenfried in Bayerisch Gmain they live – the Augsburg chickens. As the name suggests, it is a Bavarian chicken breed that is under threat of extinction. In 2009, there were only a few left in Germany. In 2018, Berghotel Rehlegg bought 15 chickens and one rooster from a breeder near Augsburg. Since then, the female and male animals have been living in a barn with plenty of outdoor space and green areas for pecking. And unlike mass-produced chickens, which live only 30 days, or organic chickens, which live 80 days, Augsburg’s chickens are weatherproof and resilient and live at least 11 months. It is a so-called “Zwiehuhn” or dual-purpose chicken because it is an excellent source of eggs and meat. The animals of the hotel live appropriate to their species, their meat and eggs have Demeter quality and are of the best taste. Try it yourself! You can find even more projects of our partner hotels here. Read more: SUSTAINABLE TRAVEL IN THAILAND – GREEN INITIATIVES AND HOTEL PROJECTS Do you like the article? Share it!"
Green Wedding: special places for a special day,"A favorite place is something very individual and personal and is defined differently by everyone. Sometimes you can’t tell exactly what defines a favorite place. You feel comfortable there, it is a special place you long for and to which you always like to return. For some people, it is a place where they can read their book in silence, for others it is a place that gives them strength. Another is happy that he can let go of all his worries in his favorite place and be a child again. We have selected the most beautiful favorite places in our Green Pearls® hotels. Maybe there is one for you? FAVORITE PLACES WITH A BEAUTIFUL VIEW An important characteristic for the ideal favorite place is for example a beautiful view. We have several ideas for you. In the Creativhotel Luise, there is a beautiful roof terrace and a viewing platform on which even an alpine pine grows. From here you have a wonderful view over Erlangen. The SCHWARZWALD PANORAMA also has a sun terrace with a fascinating view over the centuries-old spa town of Bad Herrenalb and the mountainous landscape of the Black Forest. The eco-luxury resort Gili Lankanfushi is located in the middle of an island paradise of the Indian Ocean. There is hardly a place here without a breathtaking view. However, the “Over Water Bar” is a real highlight, which could become one of your favorite places with its special location. Also, the roof terrace of the Kasbah du Toubkal with its breathtaking panoramic view into the Atlas Mountains is a top favorite place. The hotel is located somewhat remotely at the foot of Jbel Toubkal, the highest mountain in North Africa, about 60 km from Marrakech. There is even a large chessboard waiting on the roof terrace. Would you like to play chess with an unforgettable view? COZY PLACES For one person, the view is the most important thing, for the other person, coziness is the most important thing. Whether it is a reading place, a spot in front of the fireplace, or simply a cozy corner to relax. If this is your thing, then take a look at the SCHWARZWALD PANORAMA at the SPA entrance. There is a reading area, which invites you to borrow books, read, and relax. The Kasbah du Toubkal also offers a book corner. There is also a room with a 360° panorama with a view of the mountains and a magnificent fireplace. Also, Gili Lankanfushi offers a fantastic view. Comfortable day beds with a view of the sea invite you to relax in the villas. A somewhat more unusual place is the “smallest conference room” of the Creativhotel Luise. A big and old wardrobe has been converted into a small study with all the comforts one could wish for. Air-purifying moss and an unusual decoration create a very special atmosphere on 1 m2 of space. FAVORITE PLACES WHERE YOU CAN BE A CHILD AGAIN The organic family hotel Gut Nisdorf on the Baltic Sea coast, not far from the island of Rügen, is a paradise for families with children. Here the little ones have the chance to run wild and let their imagination take its course. Indians play, do handicrafts, ride horses, splash around in the swimming pond or play with the animals. But not only children will have an unforgettable time here. Here you can finally let yourself go as an adult and be a child again: scooter- or wart-carting! Why not? Nobody will look at you strangely here if you just have fun and take yourself back to a carefree childhood. For many adults who spend their vacations there, this is an absolute favorite place. FAVOURITE PLACES TO RELAX For those who want to relax the most, we have some wonderful tips. In the family hotel Gut Nisdorf there is nothing like a little nap in the hammock. Or would you rather read a book with a view into the treetops? You can also relax really well in the hotel garden of the Locanda Mistral, in the Maira Valley of Piedmont. The 900 m2 garden is covered with plants, bushes, and green areas. It’s up to you to relax in one of the deck chairs or stroll through the garden. The access to the Maira stream is another plus. A perfect place for a regenerating Kneipp cure after a hike in the mountains. Doing nothing and relaxing can also be done well in the wonderful spa of the SCHWARZWALD PANORAMAS. Enjoy a pleasant sauna, relaxing massages, or regenerating beauty treatments. FAVORITE PLACES IN NATURE Nature is the ideal place to relax, clear your head, and recharge your batteries. A day in the forest can bring miracles. In the meantime, there is even scientific evidence that so-called forest bathing has a relaxing effect on the body and mind. If you have already discovered nature as a place of power, we have some exciting tips for you in our Green Pearls hotels. A very special highlight is the La Subida Relais. There are not only three treehouses in the middle of the forest, but also a bathtub under the open sky, surrounded by ferns and trees. We are sure that this is on the top of the list! A warm bath in the middle of the countryside followed by spending the night in an idyllic treehouse? If you wish, massages can be arranged here in the forest. Gili Lankanfushi could be a favorite place in itself, because of its fantastic location on an island of the Maldives. Among the favorite places here are the famous “One Palm Island” and the hotel garden, which was laid out according to the principles of organic farming. In the SCHWARZWALD PANORAMA, we would recommend the Naschgarten as a perfect favorite place in nature. Here you can taste raspberries, blueberries, and strawberries directly from the bed or bush – because nibbling is welcome here! POWER PLACES AS FAVORITE PLACE Power places are usually places in nature that have a particularly healing energy. They have a power that helps you to come back to your own center. Just as nature produces certain healing plants, energy places can also develop very specific powers with correspondingly different effects. There are even several such power places near the SCHWARZWALD PANORAMAS: the Falcon Rock, the Amber Rock, the Devil’s Mill or the former Celtic cult site in the Dobeltal. The hotel HUBERTUS has even specialized in power places. For the hotel in the Allgäu, particularly a Geomant from the region was engaged, in order to establish different power places in the hotel. Martin Boss has created three very special power places in the hotel, each with a different effect. The roof terrace with a stone circle in Celtic style provides a feeling of peace and security – a kind of place of well-being for the soul. The Zen garden with a swastika symbol, the oldest spiritual symbol of mankind, triggers a calm, peaceful feeling. In the waiting area of the spa, there is a Mandorla installation – a kind of geometric bar code based on ancient Egyptian patterns. This is intended to help energize the body and also has a balancing and harmonizing effect. Maybe you have already found your personal favorite place in our hotels? In any case, we wish you relaxing hours, strength and a wonderful time at your favorite place! Read more: BAREFOOT – IN THESE HOTELS YOU CAN WALK WITHOUT SHOES Do you like the article? Share it!"
The 5 most beautiful eco-luxury hotels in the Alps,"Unique experiences are what makes a vacation different from everyday life. Even at night, the Green Pearls® Hotels make sure that your stay will be something special. Discover the different ways to spend the night outside and enjoy an unforgettable evening. A restful sleep On vacation, the night’s rest should be especially relaxing. By the way, the expression “beauty sleep” is a fact and not just a legend, because the tissue is renewed during sleep, which rewards us with a fresh appearance. Sleeping outdoors also has a very special fascination, because you feel a strong connection with nature. Even if you can’t sleep outside in some of the following hotels, they have thought of special moments for you. Special overnight accommodations In the Lifestylehotel SAND at Timmendorfer Strand, you will stay overnight in a very special beach chair. The two of you can experience a unique night directly on the beach. Let the first sunbeams kiss you awake and go for a swim in the Baltic Sea. Have you ever spent the night in a barn? At La Subida Relais in Firaul, you will stay in a four-poster bed in an open barn. The “Kosovic accommodation” offers you a comfortable bed right next to hay bales. All other accommodations are also very close to nature. The “Case del Bosco”, translated “houses of the forest”, have windows down to the ground, which gives you the feeling of staying overnight in the middle of nature. Experience the night peace in the mountains In two suites at the Berghotel Rehlegg, the Jacuzzis were banned from the balcony and replaced with a large mattress. The comfortable lounge can be used as an outdoor sofa during the day and at night you can stay there overnight. If you inform the hotel, the bed will be prepared outside. Then you will get warm sheets and don’t have to freeze. And you can see the stars especially well here because there is almost no air pollution here on the mountain. You can also spend a night in the mountains of Morocco: Spend the night on the roof of the Kasbah du Toubkal. If there is a group of at least ten people, the hotel will organize an evening with meshoi, traditionally prepared grilled lamb, singing, and dancing. Enjoy the special atmosphere of a wonderful night. Romantic evenings on the beach The Gili Lankanfushi in the Maldives also offers dinner by moonlight, the location is up to you. The wine cellar offers exclusive wine evenings with a delicious dinner. For the perfect relaxation, you can enjoy a partner massage at the Meera Spa. The roof of the private villas is perfect for a night under the stars. The luxury resort has many other offers for romantic vacations and honeymoons. A candlelight dinner on the beach is the special highlight of your stay at Tongsai Bay in Thailand. Pick your favorite spot on the beach and enjoy a candlelight dinner with a private chef and service staff. Also, the terrace or pool of your villa will be turned into an exclusive restaurant by the hotel team. Also at Zeavola Resort in Thailand, you can enjoy a romantic dinner on the beach. For this special experience, you don’t even need fancy shoes, because Zeavola is a barefoot resort. A night in one of the Beachfront-Suites directly on the beach is very similar to a night under the open sky. So close to the stars The Creativhotel Luise does not offer you the possibility to sleep outside, but you can still look at the stars. In some double rooms, there is a starry sky on the ceiling. As soon as the light is off, you can cuddle up in bed and even discover the stars.rs. Read more: ECO-LUXURY: 8 HOTELS THAT PERFECTLY COMBINE COMFORT AND SUSTAINABILITY Gefällt dir der Artikel?

Traveling around the world – while being vegetarian or vegan,"Day to day, our eco-hotels show how perfectly travel and sustainability can be combined. This is made possible by the people working there, contributing to a greener world. Today we are taking you with us to Marocco: accurately at the foot of the Jbel Toubkal – the highest mountain of North Africa. Here the beautiful and sustainable Kasbah du Toubkal is located about an hour and a half from Marrakech and yet in the middle of the untouched nature of the national park in the small Berber village Imlil. Unique to this vacation destination is the hotel located in the heart of the land of the Maroccan Berbers on 1.820 meters height with its majestic view. Get to know the beautiful landscape of the Toubkal National Park by hiking, trekking or renting a bike. In 1995  Mike McHugo and his brother Chris with their organization Discover Ltd. Kasbah du Toubkal welcomed guests for the first time. Since then many happy guests had the chance to learn more about the Berber culture and the nature of the Atlas Mountains. WHAT SUSTAINABILITY MEANS FOR ME… For me, sustainability means allow sustainable appropriate development whilst protecting the environment. I AM PARTICULARLY PROUD OF THIS GREEN PROJECT AT KASBAH DU TOUBKAL: The project I am most proud of was the founding of “Education For All” providing the opportunity of secondary education for girls from the rural Atlas Mountains. “Education For All” was recognised for its work by an official by TRH The Duke and Duchess of Sussex in 2019. THIS IS WHAT MAKES KASBAH DU TOUBKAL SO SPECIAL: The Kasbah du Toubkal is completely run by the local Berber population and embedded in and for the appropriate development of the fragile mountain environment. THIS IS WHAT WE PLAN FOR THE FUTURE: Our plan for the future is to carry on and do our best to protect and also provide appropriate development for the local region.

The 5 most beautiful eco-luxury hotels in the Alps,"Clean beaches and seas, unspoiled nature in the mountains – that’s what tourists want. And hotels want to deliver. The problem is that the hotel industry itself is a major source of plastic waste. Single-use plastics in the form of typical hotel slippers, small packages in the bathroom and at the buffet, along with straws and cups, add up to mountains of plastic in conventional hotels. We took a look at sustainable Green PearlsⓇ hotels, what alternatives are available and how to avoid single-use plastics in general. The problem with disposables in hotels When you stay at a hotel, you get everything you need: your luggage is taken care of, a refreshing drink is waiting for you in your room, a variety of toiletries are available in the bathroom, towels and slippers are provided… and while you are lying by the pool or sitting in the restaurant, your room is cleaned, the bed is made and all opened tubes and packages are replaced with new ones. Sound great? For sustainability-minded travelers like you, probably not. Because: All of this (among other things) creates a lot of waste. Hotels and vacation rentals definitely have a single-use problem, and it has to do with the following:: Expensive hotels produce less waste than cheap ones According to the DEHOGA environmental brochure, 0 to 2-star hotels produce 9.1 liters of waste per guest per day, 4-star hotels 3.4 liters (5-star hotels produce slightly more at 3.7 liters). According to the German Hotel and Restaurant Association (DEHOGA), this is mainly due to disposable packaging in the lower star categories. In the upscale hotel industry, less disposable packaging is used simply for style’s sake – e.g. cloth napkins instead of paper napkins, ceramic or stainless steel milk jugs instead of plastic condensed milk containers, etc. But simply choosing a higher star rating is not enough to eliminate waste and single-use packaging. Especially since not everyone can or wants to. Above all, it takes hoteliers who really care and are committed to reducing waste in their properties. Zero waste or at least “less waste” is a central concern for Green Pearls® accommodations. Each accommodation has its own approach to waste reduction, which you can read about on the Green Pearls® pages and on their individual websites. As mentioned above, many of them are Zero Waste representatives, striving for a low environmental footprint and a circular economy in all areas. We believe that Green PearlsⓇ hotels are among the lowest waste producers in the industry. “In terms of waste and plastic reduction, sustainably certified hotels are generally more advanced than non-certified hotels.” – WWF WWF study on single-use and reusable products in the hospitality industry In 2019 and 2024, WWF Germany investigated the issue of single-use plastics in the hotel industry. For the 2019 study, WWF surveyed hotels and hotel guests in Italy, France, Greece and Spain. In 2024, the data was supplemented by expert interviews and a literature review. It found that the majority of guests use significantly more reusable packaging at home than on vacation. Hoteliers are determined to act, but face many obstacles: For every 50 million disposables, only half a million reusables are sold “In 2022, the share of reusable packaging (by number of items) in the hotel industry was only 1.2 percent. (600,000 items compared to 50.6 million disposable items) and consisted almost entirely of beverage containers.” – Untersuchung der Gesellschaft für Verpackungsmarktforschung mbH (GVM) für den WWF All too often, “habit” is to blame for not using reusable products. By the way, the WWF believes that reusable products make much more sense than disposable products made from “eco-materials”. In other words, a refillable plastic bottle is better than a disposable bamboo cup. Washable cloth napkins are better than disposable napkins made from recycled cellulose. This is how sustainable hotels avoid disposable packaging Amenities upon request Many sustainable hotels and resorts have started to remove amenities such as toothbrushes, razors, sewing kits, etc. from the rooms and store them at the front desk. That way, you still get them, but only if you really need and ask for them. “By providing standard amenities only upon request, we avoid unnecessary use,” says Farmhouse Smiling Gecko in Cambodia. The resort also offers many homemade products from the resort’s own workshops, which Smiling Gecko uses to support the local community. When it comes to the amenities that are still offered on request, sustainable accommodation also ensures that they are produced sustainably and fairly. This is what the Naturresort Gerbehof in Friedrichshafen on Lake Constance reports. Honesty bar with reusable glasses instead of a minibar The minibar is another element that must be provided to meet hotel standards. In addition to energy consumption, drinks and snacks in disposable packaging also have a negative impact on the environment. Gut Guntrams near Vienna therefore installed a “central minibar” in the form of a Honesty Bar and left the individual minibars in the rooms empty. The Honesty Bar offers homemade sweet and savory treats in reusable glass jars. Homemade welcome cookies A small welcome gift for guests is a nice touch. But as Zero Waste advocate Béá Johnson says, promotional gifts and giveaways are often a source of waste. Not so at the Hotel Bella Vista Zermatt in Switzerland. There, homemade cookies on a plate greet guests in the mountains near the Matterhorn. A water bottle for the duration of your stay Many hotels provide their guests with a refillable water bottle. At the OCÉANO Health Spa Hotel on Tenerife, the “OCÉANO Glass Bottle” is available and there are water dispensers throughout the hotel where you can refill the bottle with fresh, filtered water. This fits in with the wide range of sports and wellness activities on offer and also saves a lot of bottles and miles of transportation 🙂 Source of waste: breakfast buffet? Zero waste is also an option! One of the biggest contributors to packaging and food waste in the hotel industry is the breakfast buffet. All Green Pearls® hotels have optimized this aspect. “There are no packaged products at our breakfast buffet,” reports the APIPURA hotel rinner on the ritten in South Tyrol. Instead, the child-friendly hotel offers organic products in small jars – one of the highlights are the various types of organic honey from the hotel’s own beekeeping. Zero waste measures at the breakfast buffet: Elimination of disposable hygiene products Disposable bathroom hygiene products are the second major area where mountains of plastic waste accumulate in conventional hotels. This refers to the small packages of shampoo, shower gel, soap, body lotion, shower cap, toothbrush, razor and so on. Sustainable hotels show that these products can be provided to guests in a stylish and hygienic way and do not have to be the norm. Solid Soap and Shampoo At the Klosterhof Alpine Hideaway & Spa in Berchtesgadener Land, Bavaria, the bathroom features soap and shampoo bars, as well as refillable shower gel dispensers as an alternative to traditional bottles. You can do the same at home, by the way! Dispenser Speaking of dispensers: Another option you might want to consider for the home are refillable, larger, and often more attractive dispensers for soap, shampoo, conditioner, shower gel, and the like. According to soap manufacturer MarcelsGreenSoap, a refill bag saves 85% of plastic packaging! Almost all Green Pearls® accommodations now use dispensers – with natural ingredients. “Our shampoos and shower gels (in the dispensers) are from Tiroler Kräuterhof, so they are 100% natural and regional,” reports Summit Lodges Pfunds. Biohotel Grafenast in Tyrol even offers dispensers with arnica muscle gel for relaxation after long hikes around the Pillberg 😉 Natural cosmetics free of chemicals and microplastics For our Green PearlsⓇ partners, the use of environmentally friendly cosmetic products is very important. At Pavilions Himalayas – The Farm in Nepal, you can buy bamboo toothbrushes with hemp bristles and plastic-free toothpaste tabs made according to Ayurvedic principles, as are the other personal care products. Avoiding chemicals and microplastics is particularly important to them to protect the water quality of their organic farm.. The Green Spirit hotels in Paris (Hotel Malar, Hotel Amelie and Hotel Le Pavillon, all in the central 7th arrondissement within walking distance of the Eiffel Tower) use soaps, shampoos and shower gels from Austrian natural cosmetics company Pure Green. The luxurious Klosterbräu wellness hotel in Seefeld, Tyrol, spoils its guests with premium products from Augustinus Bader – some of which have been developed exclusively for the hotel. The Lifestylehotel SAND in Timmendorfer Strand on the Baltic Sea has embraced ‘Björk&Berries‘. Nordic, sustainable, refillable and stylish,” they say. Food from their own harvest In the hotel industry, buying food in bulk is one way to reduce unnecessary packaging. Where possible, regionally. “We work almost exclusively with local suppliers to avoid long transport routes and support the regional economy,” says My Arbor near Brixen in South Tyrol. However, food packaging is avoided in particular through direct in-house production. “From cakes to chocolates to syrups, we make everything ourselves,” explains the adults-only wellness hotel. “All our fresh fruit and vegetables come from our own farm in Albisano on Lake Garda. The owner, Mr Huber, personally takes care of the harvest and brings the produce directly to the hotel (without packaging waste) so that our guests can enjoy the freshest ingredients.” – My Arbor Dishes and glasses Disposable plastic cups at hotels? They do exist! Some hoteliers find them more convenient and less risky than glass or porcelain, especially for the lawn or pool. Unfortunately, they create a huge amount of waste. Sustainable hotels are careful to use only high-quality, plastic-free materials. The energy-independent aparthotel OLM Nature Escape in Sand in Taufers, South Tyrol, uses only glass, porcelain, ceramic, clay and enamel for food and drink. Tablecloths and napkins Just as glass and porcelain are more stylish than plastic tableware, cloth napkins are more sophisticated than paper napkins. You can find them, for example, at the Relais del Maro in Liguria. The Albergo Diffuso in the picturesque village of Borgomaro takes care to avoid waste in all areas. Consequently, linen tablecloths are washed rather than thrown away. Towel change upon request only Since laundry does not produce waste, but does use detergent, water and energy, daily hotel laundry is another factor that you, as a guest, can help with. Many guests notice that even towels that have been hung up are all replaced the next day. This calls for well-trained staff who, like at the Lifestyle Resort Zum Kurfürsten on the Mosel, change towels only when requested. Even in the large wellness area with sauna and several pools, guests are asked to use sauna towels sparingly and sometimes several times. Forgoing daily room cleaning and turn-down service Similarly, as a guest, you can support a hotel’s sustainability efforts by choosing not to have your room cleaned daily. In most cases, you have to explicitly decline. For example, the sustainable Hotel Luise in Erlangen, Germany, tried to switch to opt-in (i.e., you get daily room cleaning only if you want it), but that would have meant being stripped of all their hotel stars by the Hotel Stars Union! However, at the ADLER Lodge RITTEN in South Tyrol (a luxurious all-inclusive resort close to nature), the turndown service has become an opt-in offer. This means that rooms are only prepared in the evening if you, the guest, specifically request it. No slippers The slippers provided in a hotel’s spa area are disposable products that generate huge amounts of waste. According to the German magazine Focus, the Steigenberger Hotels alone (a total of 60 hotels and resorts) would order 180,000 pairs of slippers for their guests each year. One can only imagine the mountain of slipper waste in the entire industry! The HUBERTUS Mountain Refugio Allgäu has therefore removed the slippers from the rooms and will only provide them upon request. Instead, guests are asked to bring their own. The romantic Hotel Das Rübezahl in Füssen, Germany, takes a similar approach to the slipper issue: guests are only provided with hotel slippers for the spa upon request, and the slippers are made of linen and cork, making them compostable. Backpack and shopping bag provided In many vacation destinations, plastic bags are still the norm. Even though a lot of plastic waste could be avoided! That is why CERVO Mountain Resort Zermatt in Switzerland provides guests with both a backpack for hiking and reusable bags for shopping. Digital Guest Magazine Digitization also reduces waste. Guests receive a digital reservation confirmation, there is a digital guest magazine and digital services. At the Eco-Hotel Okelmann’s, for example, you can download Komoot maps created by Senior Okelmann to your phone so you can start cycling right away. The Hotel Klosterbräu in Seefeld, Tyrol, has a guest channel on the hotel TV where you can find out about all the events and offers at the hotel. Offering waste separation for guests As mentioned at the beginning, many people use more disposable items on vacation than at home. Recycling is also often not as successful on vacation. However, this is not always the guests’ fault… You may have experienced the situation where there is only one disposable waste bin in the hotel room and you don’t even have the opportunity to separate your own waste. Some hotels may also think that their international guests don’t know how to it. Not so at Keemala on the island of Phuket in Thailand. “We have clearly marked recycling and waste stations throughout the resort, making it easy for guests to dispose of their waste properly,” they wrote to us. Unlike many internationally managed hotels on the island of Phuket, Keemala is owned by a local family who are very conscious of their impact on the environment. The 5-star ADLER Lodge RITTEN is another example of how in-room waste separation can be done in style. Toilet paper made out of Tetra Pak According to Statista, global per capita consumption of toilet paper reach almost 14 kilograms per person in 2023. However, in Germany, the figure is much higher, at 30.6 kilograms per person. A lot of trees have to be cut down to produce all this fresh fiber. The SCHWARZWALD PANORAMA in Bad Herrenalb has switched to toilet paper made from recycled beverage cartons. This reflects the concept of recycling that the wellness and selfness hotel also applies to its room furnishings. Wooden coffee pods eliminate single-use plastics Coffee capsule machines are definitely not the most sustainable way to make coffee. However, they are a great solution for allowing guests in a hotel suite to make their own coffee. The Birkenhof***** Spa and Genuss Resort uses Rezemo wooden coffee capsules. They contain coffee from sustainable sources. The other amenities of the 5-star wellness hotel are packaged in plastic-free cardboard as well. Zero-Waste Goodbye Gift When you leave, hotels often give you a small parting gift – and that too is a source of packaging waste. Of course, sustainable hotels have also thought about how to give you, the guest, a gift that is both beautiful and environmentally friendly. At the Naturhotel Outside in the Hohe Tauern National Park in East Tyrol, Austria, guests receive a jar of homemade jam in a reusable glass jar. The Hotel Weihrerhof in South Tyrol, on the Italian side of the Alps, offers soaps from its own organic cosmetics line, BergSea, which uses water from the Wolfsgruben Lake, located directly in front of the hotel. “We want our guests to take the soaps home with them and continue to dream of the Weihrerhof,” says the host family. As you can see, Green PearlsⓇ hotels have put a lot of thought into how they can eliminate single-use items, waste and plastic, which means you may use no more single-use items on your vacation than you would at home – in fact, you may use fewer items than at home!"
In the Gardens of our Green Pearls Partners,"Lying by the pool, sipping a chilled lemonade, taking in the view, perhaps even joining a guided tour to explore the stunning natural surroundings and ancient temples – doing good can be so rewarding. All it takes is a charity hotel. What are charity hotels? The term “charity hotel” was coined by Trivago, a hotel search engine, to describe hotels that are actively involved in social causes and donate a portion of their resources or income to charitable causes. Charity hotels are either part of or have a partnership with a non-profit organization. The benefit to you is that you can have a direct positive impact on the local community at your destination without spending extra money or volunteering. Here are three hotels that have made a commitment to a good cause. #1 Farmhouse Smiling Gecko – Luxury Resort and Work & Education Campus in Cambodia The Farmhouse Smiling Gecko in Cambodia is part of the Smiling Gecko Association based in Switzerland. In 2014, the organization founded the “Smiling Gecko Campus” there. With an initial nine hectares, about 60 kilometers from the capital Phnom Penh. The campus has since grown to 150 hectares and is home to a school, kindergarten, handicraft businesses and training centers, as well as agriculture and livestock. A central component is the Farmhouse Smiling Gecko Resort. There are a total of 34 rooms in luxurious houses and bungalows, a swimming pool with pool bar and sundeck. And the hotel restaurant, the gourmet restaurant UN, where chef Mariya Un Noun has made Cambodian fine dining famous far beyond the borders. (You can read more about the restaurant in our blog article about hotel restaurants). Smiling Gecko is all about education and jobs. The jobs are fairly paid and the workshops – such as carpentry, sewing and butchery – are run according to modern Swiss standards. The furniture for the accommodation is made by the carpentry workshop. While the food in the restaurant comes from their own agriculture, cattle breeding and fish farming. A way out of poverty Many of the people who have found work here originally came from the slums of Phnom Penh. As described by the Taramana organization, Cambodia is one of the poorest countries in Southeast Asia. And life in the slums is characterized by overcrowding, unemployment, inadequate sanitation, poor educational opportunities, and poverty. The Smiling Gecko Campus is able to accommodate many people with their whole family. While the parents work on the farm, the children go to kindergarten, school or start an apprenticeship in one of the workshops or at the resort. To ensure that there is enough work for everyone, tourists are encouraged to visit the resort. Here you can enjoy a relaxing and sustainable vacation and use the Green PearlsⓇ Resort as your base to explore Cambodia. Top attractions include temple complexes such as the famous Angkor Wat, floating villages, river markets and pepper plantations. If you are interested in the campus, there are also tours that will give you a better understanding of the entire project. And when you return home, you may find yourself continuing to be a supporter and voice for the project. #2 The Pavillons Himalaya – The Farm – Support for children and organic farming in Nepal According to USAID, Nepal is one of the poorest countries in the world. Poverty particularly affects young girls and women. And tragically, illegal human trafficking is widespread, with many being trafficked to India and beyond. The Pavilions Himalayas – The Farm raises awareness and supports the organization Right4Children by donating 70 percent of its net profits to the empowerment of children. Right4Children supports children and youth Since 1995, Right4Children has operated day centers that provide free childcare and hot meals. There are programs for all ages up to adolescence. As The Pavilions Himalayas reports, funding the Right4Children center in Pokhara (on the same site as the resort) was a motivation from the beginning to build the sustainable tourist accommodation. There are 15 spacious, luxurious Nepalese style villas with stunning views of the countryside and a swimming pool. Sightseeing tours and safaris are available, as well as in-house yoga and meditation. (Learn more about the yoga offerings in our article on sustainable yoga retreats for pros.) Das zweite Standbein ist die ökologische Landwirtschaft, welche das Resort umgibt. Auch hier ist The Pavilions von Anfang an engagiert und baut selbst Bio-Produkte für die Küche an. Zudem motiviert die Nachfrage nach Bio-Produkten, die das Hotel generiert, den Umbau konventioneller Landwirtschaften zu Biobetrieben in der Region. Weitere nachhaltige Maßnahmen sind die Verwendung von Solarenergie, Grauwasser, Erzeugung von Biogas und die Herstellung biologisch abbaubarer Pflegeartikel aus natürlichen Zutaten der Region. #3 Green City Hotel Vauban – Ecologically oriented integration company in Germany Although not a charity hotel in the strict sense, the Green City Hotel Vauban was founded as a hotel with a focus on inclusion and social responsibility from the outset. Located in Freiburg, in the south of Germany, the shareholders of the hotel are the association Freiburger Sozialarbeit e.V. and the municipal housing company Freiburger Stadtbau GmbH. 50 percent of its trainees and employees are people with disabilities who have found a fair and sustainable place to work. The hotel also works with other integrative organizations among its suppliers. For example, its coffee is sourced from a roastery that operates as an integrative organization, and the hotel works with Hofgut Himmelreich for the education and training of its employees. The modern city hotel is largely barrier-free and built in an environmentally friendly way. You will stay in rooms with a bright and friendly architecture and you will be directly connected to the light rail, which will take you to the city center in just 10 minutes. A free regional ticket is available for your stay. 👉 See what you can experience on a sustainable weekend in Freiburg, Germany, here. A stay at Green PearlsⓇ charity hotels offers you not only relaxation and experiences. But also the opportunity to actively contribute to the well-being of others."
Green Wedding: special places for a special day,"Sound massage with Tibetan singing bowls is a wellness trend that is becoming increasingly popular in sustainable hotels that cater to mindful guests. You can find it in Green PearlsⓇ hotels around the world, including Nepal, Cambodia, Thailand, Italy, and Germany. Some offer it as part of their weekly program, others offer it as a spa treatment, and some even organize entire sound massage retreats. Here you can find out where you can add a sound massage to your next trip – and the benefits it can bring you. Peace and relaxation through singing bowls “The massages bring about a state of absolute relaxation that is unique. Even highly stressed people find peace within a short time.” That is how Maren Geisler-Okelmann of the Yoga-Hotel Okelmann’s in Warpe describes the effect of the singing bowls. The hostess is a trained yoga teacher and conducts sound therapy according to Peter HessⓇ in her courses and retreats. The Peter HessⓇ Institute is only 7 km from Warpe! Singing bowl massage according to Peter HessⓇ The singing bowl massage, which is a wellness trend in many places today, was developed by Peter Hess about 30 years ago. The German engineer for physical technology came into contact with singing bowls during his travels in Nepal. According to the institute’s website, he “succeeded in adapting ancient Far Eastern knowledge from the Himalayas about sound and rhythm and their healing effects on body, mind, and soul to the needs of people in Western societies.” It is not entirely clear how singing bowls were originally used. Some researchers even suggest that they were simply used as cooking utensils and that the tradition was “invented” later on. Others suggest that singing bowls once played an important role in Buddhism – but that the tradition has been lost. The Peter HessⓇ Institute (PHI) now has 16 academies in 14 countries and claims to have trained approximately 10,000 people in the Peter Hess Sound Massage Method (protected in Europe). How does a singing bowl massage work? During a Peter HessⓇ singing bowl massage, several singing bowls are placed on the (clothed) body and sounded. The bowls, which are cast in brass or bronze, produce a gong-like sound with fine vibrations. These vibrations are transmitted to the body and are said to “release blockages” and lead to relaxation. Both physical (muscle relaxation) and mental. A singing bowl massage usually lasts between 30 and 90 minutes. “Circling thoughts come to rest,” reports Maren vom Okelmann’s. One enters a “pleasant state in which one can let go.” The vibrations emanating from the singing bowls spread through the skin, tissues, bones, organs, and fluids of the body, creating a “gentle, internal massage.” “Experiencing sound is a wonderful and healing thing.” – Maren Geisler-Okelmann 👉Here you can book a sound massage at Okelmann’s. Difference between singing bowl massage and a sound bath In some wellness and yoga hotels, you can have a sound bath in addition to a singing bowl massage. The difference is: For a singing bowl massage, the bowls are placed on the body, while for a sound bath, the bowls are placed in the room. A sound bath is especially suitable for groups. The vibrations of the gong are transferred from the bowl to the body. At the Biohotel Grafenast in Tyrol, a sound bath in small groups is part of the weekly program, and you can also book a “singing bowl massage with Sabine” at any time. 60 minutes cost 85 Euro and 90 minutes 120 Euro. At Biohotel Grafenast you can experience a great combination of a Tyrolean nature vacation with an Alpine panorama and Far Eastern relaxation methods. The family-run hotel and its surroundings have been designed according to Feng Shui as a place of power, and yoga and Qigong classes are also available. As part of its in-house treatments, the HUBERTUS Mountain Refugio Allgäu offers both a sound bath and a sound massage. The cost for a 50-minute sound bath is 120 euros alone and 180 euros with another person. The sustainable hotel in Balderschwang practices an “Ayurvedic lifestyle” – both in the wellness area and in the culinary arts. The sounds and vibrations of the singing bowls are considered to be energy that “can set every single cell in the body vibrating.” This is believed to have a healing effect. 👉For more information, visit HUBERTUS Ayurveda. Sound baths in the Italian ADLER Spa Resorts & Lodges weekly program The sustainable and luxurious ADLER Spa Resorts & Lodges in Italy also believe in the benefits of sound baths and have made them an integral part of their wellness programs. “At ADLER Spa Resort SICILIA, we offer the ‘Gong Sound’ experience every Wednesday, Friday, and Saturday,” the team explains. “This treatment uses the slow, rhythmic beats of the gong, punctuated by brief moments of silence.” At the ADLER Lodge Ritten* the Klangbad takes place every Wednesday and Saturday. The location on the Ritten plateau in South Tyrol is ideal for combining an active vacation in nature with wellness. “You may find yourself taking a short but sweet nap during the sound treatments. The gentle sounds promote such a deep relaxation that a relaxed sleep is simply part of the experience, making it even more intense.” – ADLER Lodge RITTEN Sound bath as an included service The German hotel Das Rübezahl in the Allgäu region, like ADLER Spa Resorts & Lodges, offers sound baths as an included weekly program. In addition to the sound massage sessions, yoga and Qigong are also offered. Meditation with singing bowls Some Green PearlsⓇ hotels combine singing bowls with meditation. For example, the spa at CERVO Mountain Resort Zermatt in Switzerland offers a “singing bowl meditation” as part of its weekly yoga and meditation program. The sound bath helps calm the mind and release tension in the body. Guests leave feeling “more balanced and serene.” My Arbor* near Brixen in South Tyrol offers both singing bowl massage and singing bowl meditation. “It is a special form of relaxation that many of our guests love. They report feeling a deep sense of calm and lightness during the singing bowl treatment.” – Hotel My Arbor What is the difference between a singing bowl massage and a singing bowl meditation? The Keemala Resort on the island of Phuket in Thailand has answered this question. According to the resort, singing bowl massage is more about relaxing the muscles and stimulating circulation, while singing bowl meditation focuses on the mind. The goal of meditation is to achieve “mental clarity” through sounds and vibrations. Sound Healing Retreats If you want to delve deeper into the world of singing bowl healing, there are also a few retreats available. The Hotel Klosterhof – Alpine Hideaway & Spa hosted its first “Sound Healing Retreat” with Lisa Schuster, a physician and sound therapist from Munich. The three-night retreat included various sound baths, singing bowl massage, singing bowl meditation, toning exercises, yoga, and a cocoa ceremony. At the Gut Sonnenhausen near Munich, Germany, singing bowls and cocoa ceremonies were also combined during the “Finding Peace Day Retreat” held in the fall of 2024. The retreat was led by Thails de la Paz, who works regularly with the Sonnenhausen Estate. Sustainable wellness hotels with a Far Eastern touch Yoga, mindfulness, TCM, Ayurveda, singing bowls – much of the modern Western lifestyle has its origins in East Asia. In addition to the Okelmann’s, Grafenast, and HUBERTUS Mountain Refugio hotels already mentioned, the Green PearlsⓇ hotels, which are sustainably and individually managed, include many others inspired by Far Eastern culture. Stephan Bode, owner of the SCHWARZWALD PANORAMA in Bad Herrenalb, Germany, draws his personal strength from the words of Buddha and has integrated a Selfness Center into the hotel. Here, guests are offered mindfulness training, resilience, forest bathing, and fasting cures. Singing bowl massages are an optional extra. Heiner Buckermann designed the entire Lifestyle Resort Zum Kurfürsten in Bernkastel-Kues on the Mosel River according to Feng Shui (with the help of a Chinese master). He also integrated a TCM center into the hotel. He places great importance on the 5 elements and wants the life energy Qi to flow freely throughout the hotel. Among the treatments available at the TCM Center is a singing bowl massage based on the 5 elements. “Based on the five elements of traditional Chinese medicine, the goal is to achieve a healing balance of the organs, which stimulates the organism to regenerate itself. By placing and striking the body with singing bowls of different sizes, (…) qi, blood and emotions can flow freely again.” – Lifestyle Resort Zum Kurfürsten A 30-minute sound massage costs 47 euros. Singing bowl massage in Nepal The Himalayan region of Nepal is where Peter Hess was introduced to singing bowls and where the trend that is sweeping the West began. At the Pavilions Himalayas – The Farm you can experience the original Nepalese version of the singing bowl treatment. The sustainably managed resort is known for its yoga classes with Yogi Shyam Gurung, who we featured in our Yoga for pros blog post. His retreats are not only about physical exercises but also about a theoretical, traditional understanding of yoga. Sound bowls are used here in conjunction with meditation, Reiki, self-healing, and Ayurvedic treatments. “We offer yoga, meditation, and sound bowl sessions either as individual sessions or in small groups that know each other well,” the resort says. Singing bowl massage in Cambodia In Cambodia, you can receive a singing bowl massage at the Farmhouse Smiling Gecko. Buddhism is the state religion and singing bowls have a long tradition in Buddhism. It is said that singing bowls existed at the time of the historical Buddha. However, little is known about their exact origin and original meaning. At the luxurious Farmhouse Smiling Gecko Resort, you can experience the country authentically while supporting the Smiling Gecko Project. It supports the local population through training centers, a school, organic farming, and fair employment. Sound bowl meditation and science Finally, it is important to note that the effectiveness of a singing bowl massage is not scientifically proven and falls within the realm of alternative medicine. However, you may find that sometimes a beautiful sound is more pleasant than a long speech 🙂 *CIN: IT021072A1QCJQTLUQ (ADLER Lodge Ritten) *CIN: IT021011A1AE4737IT (My Arbor) Save this blog article on Pinterest"
The 5 most beautiful eco-luxury hotels in the Alps,"Want to be sustainable on vacation and be a model (sustainable) hotel guest? Then read on to find out what hoteliers are saying about what their valued guests should NOT do while on vacation 🙂 Support, not undermine, the efforts of sustainable hotels and accommodation When it comes to the do’s and don’ts of travel, this article looks at it from a sustainability perspective. In other articles of this kind, for example, one of the first rules is often: “Don’t dress like a tourist!” Trekking sandals and necklaces (as you probably know) are not considered fashionable – but from an ecological point of view, we don’t see a problem here! However, too much revealing clothing on vacation can offend the religious and cultural sensitivities of local people, as Indonesian Lucienne Anhar explains in our Bali blog post. On this blog, we feature privately and individually owned hotels and vacation rentals that demonstrate sustainable and environmentally friendly practices in all areas. You will often see small signs reminding you that you can do without fresh towels every day (a simple measure that contributes significantly to the conservation of energy, fresh water, and detergents in the tourism industry). But sometimes, as guests, we may not even be aware that our behavior is undermining the resort’s sustainability efforts in one way or another. So it’s time to ask our hotelier partners what we might want to avoid doing. Don’ts for a sustainable vacation at a hotel #1 Use your own shampoo At The Pavilions Himalayas – The Farm (just named one of the 22 “Absolute Best Hotels in Asia” by Fodor’s Travel), guests are not encouraged to use their own shampoo and shower gel. The simple reason is that the Nepalese resort is run according to ecological criteria and is surrounded by organic farmland. The water cycles of the farm, the kitchen, and the resort are all connected. Chemicals, pollutants, and microplastics, which are often found in many conventional shower products, can harm the farm, the hotel team explains. “We encourage our guests to use the bathroom products we provide because they are all natural and chemical free.” – The Pavilions Himalayas – The Farm #2 Balloons at hotel parties Have you ever considered that balloons are not environmentally friendly decorations or gifts? For this reason, they are not allowed on Gut Sonnenhausen in Glonn (near Munich). “We do a lot of weddings and one thing we don’t do is balloons. Since we are in the middle of a nature reserve, too many balloons and strings end up in the trees or on the ground, where they are nibbled by animals. But this is well accepted by our guests.” – Gut Sonnenhausen #3 Bringing snacks and food to the resort Don’t bring your own snacks, drinks, and take-out food to the resort – you might think, sure, they want to make money. But as Farmhouse Smiling Gecko in Cambodia tells us, they are particularly concerned about the packaging waste. The food that is brought in is usually wrapped in plastic, which ends up as garbage at the resort. And by the way, it’s not a bad thing to support the farmhouse and its Smiling Gecko project. It runs an organic farm, a school, and training centers for employees (or their children) and the local population on its premises. #4 Take bread from the breakfast buffet – yes or no? Should you take bread from the breakfast buffet to make a sandwich for lunch? Our Green PearlsⓇ partners have very different answers to this question, depending on the region in which the hotel is located. At the HUBERTUS Mountain Refugio Allgäu in Balderschwang, for example, the breakfast buffet offers extra “Jausesackerl”, which you can take with you for a snack on the mountain. At the Naturhotel Outside in East Tyrol, however, this is not welcomed. The hiking hotel is located in the middle of the Hohe Tauern Alpine National Park and believes it is important to support the local huts. For them, this is an aspect of economic and social sustainability. “We want our guests to stop and eat at the huts. That’s why we only offer a snack in the afternoon and don’t make snack packs to give away for hikes or anything like that.” – Naturhotel Outside #5 Smoking in Paris In Paris, people smoke a lot more than in other European cities. Every year, the city disposes of about 350 tons (!) of cigarette butts! The Green Spirit Hotels (Hotel Le Pavilions, Amelie and Malar, all in the lively 7th arrondissement, within walking distance of the Seine and the Eiffel Tower) are not happy about this. The small, independent hotels use special air filters to ensure fresh air, and smoking is only allowed in the green courtyard. Sometimes guests stub out their cigarettes in the flower pots! “Even though there are plenty of ashtrays outside!” In case you didn’t know, a cigarette butt is made of plastic and toxins, and especially when watering your plants, the toxins get into the plants, which is why you really shouldn’t do it! Neither in the garden nor outside (because the same thing happens there, only on a larger scale)! The correct place to dispose of them is the garbage. #6 Stealing hotel equipment as a “souvenir” – Please do not do this on vacation Do we really have to say that? Unfortunately, yes. Just on my last vacation (in a nature wagon in the Eifel) we asked the operator if we could have cutlery. “There is cutlery,” he was sure. But apparently, the previous tenants had taken it home… In 2023, the hotel portal Wellness Heaven conducted a survey of around 1,400 European hoteliers, which showed that towels and bathrobes are the most frequently taken items, especially in 5-star hotels. The AC Hotels by Marriott chain reported that approximately 1,250 towels per hotel (!) are stolen each year in a total of 64 hotels. Our partner, the aparthotel OLM Nature Escape in South Tyrol, only opened a year ago and is currently considering how to deal with this problem. “We place more trust in our valued guests than usual; we use valuable items and amenities. For example, a high quality sauna towel in the ApartSuite, high quality kitchen utensils, glasses, porcelain… Some guests take advantage of this and steal from us. They do not appreciate the generosity.” – OLM Nature Escape As you can see, the many little “oh, it won’t be noticed” actions of individual guests add up to a lot of damage, and are therefore clearly antisocial, unsustainable behavior, and things you shouldn’t do on vacation. (And you’re not legally allowed to do them either.) #7 Wasting energy At home, people conserve electricity because it costs money, and in hotels – it’s free. People who think like that don’t think very deeply. You would think that people who book sustainable hotels would have a certain sensitivity when it comes to conserving resources. Unfortunately, that is not necessarily the case. The Naturresort Gerbehof on Lake Constance is surprised by guests who “take showers several times a day, want their towels changed daily, or use a large number of towels in the sauna”. Hotel Bella Vista Zermatt in Switzerland also had guests who wanted their sheets changed “every day. Also sad is when guests “take too much food and then leave everything on the table”. Here are a few more tips for saving energy – at the hotel, too: #8 Trash “Waste is a big problem in general,” says Marco Spiess of Summit Lodges in Pfunds. Guests at the vacation homes in Pfunds, Tyrol, cook for themselves and bring their own food. The host notes: “In some cases, huge amounts of unopened food are thrown away, even though it is still fresh. He tries to point this out to his guests, but it often falls on “deaf ears”. The luxurious Keemala Resort in Thailand has a zero-waste policy and there are no plastic bottles, straws, or the like throughout the resort. Therefore, it is annoying when people bring plastic products from outside. It would also be desirable for guests to recycle their waste properly. There are signs of improvement The Lifestylehotel SAND in Timmendorfer Strand on the Baltic Sea has a positive story to tell about “guest education”. They started early to communicate their “sustainable lifestyle” both internally and to their guests. “It is important not to formulate prohibitions, but to ask for help.” – Marion Muller, Lifestlyhotel SAND She considers it a success that the demand for to-go cups, for example, has become an “exception”. The Biohotel Grafenast in Tyrol is also proud to report that it is very satisfied with the ecological awareness of its guests: „Most of our guests are very conscious of sustainability and live sustainably.“ – Biohotel Grafenast In general, you should continue to do the sustainable things you do at home while you are on vacation. Even though some sustainable practices may not be as common in the country where you are vacationing. “Going wild” on vacation is not trendy at the moment. And it never really has been. Do you have other experiences, examples, or tips for vacation dos and don’ts? Write them down in the comments!"
The 5 most beautiful eco-luxury hotels in the Alps,"Did you know that some of our Green PearlsⓇ hotels are designated Sites of Power? Or that they offer guided tours/hikes to recognized places of power in their area? Find out what they are here. But not only these places of power have a special effect: we also show you some special natural sites that will definitely invite you to stop and reflect. What is a place of power? “Places of power are in vogue. But their effects are not scientifically proven.” SRF in its article on magical nature A place of power is a geographical location in nature where, according to esoteric belief, a particular energy or earth radiation exists. Scientific methods cannot prove this; instead, people identify such places using a pendulum or divining rod.People also designate some power places based on ley lines or Feng Shui principles. Some (or many) also use the term for places in nature that are simply beautiful and subjectively uplifting. You can probably think of an example right now, can’t you? Places of power and tourism Powerful sites are key attractions in the tourism industry—take Stonehenge, for example! In 2019, authorities closed Ayers Rock in Uluru-Kata Tjuta National Park after the Anangu people protested. They opposed the increasing number of tourists climbing their sacred mountain, damaging the environment, and trampling on their cultural heritage. Uluru holds deep cultural and religious significance for Australia’s indigenous people. However, with our Green PearlsⓇ partners, we don’t get the impression that power places are being exploited for tourism. Instead, they often align with the personal worldview of the individual hotel hosts, particularly in the case of Feng Shui power places. Lifestyle Resort Zum Kurfürsten – An entire hotel as a Feng Shui place of power “The entire hotel has been declared a place of power by a Feng Shui master from Beijing.” – Zum Kurfürsten Lifestyle Resort Feng Shui and TCM play an important role at Lifestyle Resort Zum Kurfürsten. The wellness hotel in Bernkastel-Kues on the Mosel River used to be a simple hotel for coach tours – until Heiner Buckermann took over and transformed it into the lifestyle resort it is today. Today, it boasts a 4,500-square-foot wellness area with saunas, pools and a natural swimming pond, as well as a diet based on the Five Elements and TCM therapy. Heiner Buckermann remembers the construction phase and the Feng Shui master: “The master was visiting Germany from Beijing and met one of our TCM therapists. We were building at the time and asked for his help. The master explained the details of how to connect the energies in the place of power.” The goal was to ensure that the entire place stayed coherent and, like a turtle’s shell, blocked negative energies. To achieve this, they directed the water from the various pools to flow in a specific way, and followed precise instructions on maintaining contact with the street or hotel staircase to protect the energy of the Power Place. By connecting all the outbuildings to the main building, the energy can “flow freely”. The choice of materials, the polygonal tiles, the nine flags on the street – everything follows the Feng Shui rules for a place of power. According to Heiner Buckermann, the Feng Shui instructions were all “logical” and “pleasant” and “contributed positively to the design of the hotel. The master himself then declared the entire hotel to be a place of power, and anyone sensitive to this can still feel it today. Biohotel Grafenast – A place of power, confirmed by geomancers Peter Unterlechner of the Biohotel Grafenast in Tyrol, Austria, also believes in flowing qi and has had the hotel, now in its third generation, aligned accordingly. “We had the grounds designed according to Feng Shui and then had them tested by a geomancer,” says Peter Unterlechner. The geomancer confirmed that both the hotel and the surrounding nature are places of power. The hotel sits beautifully in the mountains, offering stunning views of the valley. “The panoramic location and the combination of an old house and a fresh spirit bring the power to life and make it tangible” – Biohotel Grafenast You can create your own places of power As you can see from the examples, you can create your own places of power by implementing certain esoteric rules. “We have created various places of power ourselves,” reports the HUBERTUS Mountain Refugio Allgäu. There are various retreats in the wellness area of the Mountain Spring Spa and the “Power of Silence” place with a bonsai tree. The sustainably managed hotel is also an advocate of Ayurveda and mindfulness, offering yoga classes and retreats throughout the year. At Naturhotel Gerbehof, the owners strongly believe in the Philippi method. They offer bioenergetic motivation sessions in-house, and there is a stone circle in their private forest where guests can experience a “meditation on the four primary elements.” Crystal Garden at Gut Guntrams If you are interested in crystals, the Gut Guntrams near Vienna has an impressive crystal garden with some huge exhibits. However, owner Stefan Gergley does not make any esoteric connections. He simply has a passion for crystals, petrified wood and minerals, he explains, and shares them in his private collection and his own nature museum at Gut Guntrams. Places of power around sustainable hotels Many Green PearlsⓇ accommodations are located near one or more places of power. The way these sites are transformed into a tourist experience varies widely. The “Snake God’s” place of worship must not be disturbed For example, Rajiv Desraj Shrestha, general manager of The Pavilions Himalayas – The Farm in Nepal, knows of a place of power near the resort – but he won’t take you there because he thinks tourists (and people in general) are a disruptive factor. “We have a place of power. It is a very old place of worship according to Hindu understanding, dedicated to the ‘Snake God’ and according to Hinduism can only be worshipped on certain auspicious days. In general, it is disturbed by human presence and therefore a visit is not recommended.” – Rajiv Desraj Shrestha Temples and the “holy forest” to experience in Thailand At Keemala in Phuket, on the other hand, the surrounding power spots are integrated into the program. They tell us there are three areas: The enchantingly beautiful Keemala Resort is nestled in the tropical forest of Phuket. Guests of the Hotel Weihrerhof in South Tyrol will receive a “power places booklet”. The Pichler family, who run the Hotel Weihrerhof* on the shores of Lake Costalovara in Renon, South Tyrol, actively sought out places of natural power in the area around their hotel. This came about because the host family carefully studied the surrounding nature. Of particular interest are the Celtic-Rhaetian sites and settlements typical of the Ritten. When exploring places of power, their goal is to “feel more and think less”. In order to understand the energy involved, they have enlisted the help of geomancer Bernd Traber. As a guest, you will find a small booklet in your room in which you can learn more about each place and get ideas for consciously experiencing them. Afterwards you can visit them with a new feeling and let nature have a deeper effect on you. Hotel room design inspired by a place of power in Bad Herrenalb The SCHWARZWALD PANORAMA has just renovated its hotel rooms (according to Cradle to Cradle™) and created the room category “Falkenstein”. The Falkenstein is a local landmark in Bad Herrenalb, and according to hotel owner Stephan Bode, the “vibrating primeval energy” is particularly noticeable here. He wanted the new hotel rooms to reflect this: “As soon as you enter the room, you feel a unique and unbridled energy – powerful and balanced. Falkenstein is the perfect design concept for every guest who wants to feel primal power.” Bad Herrenalb – a place of power There are also other places of power in the area, such as one “directly above the junction of the two supercontinents of Gondwana and Laurasia”. The entire town of Bad Herrenalb is considered a healing place of power, evident from the unusually large number of twin trees, a wonder pine growing on an archway, and its healing water and climate. The hotel team emphasizes that you don’t have to believe in the special power of Bad Herrenalb to feel it: “Even guests unfamiliar with the special qualities of the place often confirm at check-out that they feel relaxed and energized.” – SCHWARZWALD PANORAMA Recharge your batteries in Warper Wood Sisters Maren Geisler-Okelmann and Kristin Okelmann of eco-hotel Okelmann’s in Warpe are spiritually open. The water that flows through their pipes has been revitalized using the Grander method, and the hotel offers yoga, meditation, and sound massages. “Our power spot, almost on our doorstep, is the magical Warper Wood. We do some retreats that include forest bathing. We spend as much time there as possible.” – Hotel Okelmanns “Heartstone” Place of Power near Hotel Klosterhof – Alpine Hideaway & Spa The health hotel Klosterhof – Alpine Hideaway & Spa has a focus on medicine and is happy to offer scientifically based methods (e.g. medical liver fasting instead of other types of fasting). Additionally, you can participate in a guided forest bathing tour. The guide Jana likes to integrate the power place Herzstein into her tour. It is only a 5 minute walk from the hotel. Lisa-Maria Standl from the hotel says: “I’ve been there several times, and even though it’s a bit esoteric, I think the word ‘place of power’ is appropriate. Hexenbödele on the Ritten in South Tyrol Near the APIPURA hotel rinner* on the Ritten in South Tyrol, there is a mystical place called “Hexenbödele”. It is a forest clearing with a larch tree in the middle. Legend says that devils and witches once danced here. One night, a young boy, wanting to prove his courage, visited the place. By morning, they found him lifeless—trampled to death by the witches. After this tragic event, they hung a crucifix in the larch tree to honor the boy, and since then, the witches are said to avoid the place. In addition to the Hexenböderle, Karin Rinner from the hotel’s host family recommends the Waldner Eck and the Mitterstieler See viewpoint. “I often visit the places of power around us because they are breathtaking sites where you can get a lot of strength.” – Karin Rinner Stone circle in Seefeld In Seefeld, where the sustainable Hotel Klosterbräu is located, there is a stone circle as a place of power. They built it on the Pfarrerbichl as a “magical place.” In 2000, they measured the constellation, and in 2007, they inaugurated the place of power. The 12 stones are meant to represent the 12 apostles, and in the middle, there is a way of the cross, starting from the parish church in Seefeld. The Hotel Klosterbräu was built on the 500-year-old walls of an old monastery. The staff here likes to play with biblical names. The sunbathing area by the outdoor pool is called the “Garden of Eden.” And down in the vaults is the “Cellar of Sin“. Places of natural power with our Green PearlsⓇ partners As we researched the places of power among our Green PearlsⓇ partners, many emphasized the natural treasures of their surroundings. The sea as an inexhaustible source of energy in Tenerife At the OCÉANO Health Spa Hotel on the island of Tenerife, they believe that the Atlantic Ocean, which borders the hotel, is a powerful source of energy. “The sea gives peace and strength. You can feel and experience this source of strength and find your own rhythm.” – OCÉANO Health Spa Hotel The sea also plays an important role in the various health therapies offered by the hotel, such as “Ocean Balancing” or “Thalasso”. Subjective places of power in East Tyrol The Naturhotel Outside in Matrei in East Tyrol immediately named four places that, in their opinion, are suitable for subjective experience as a place of power.: The best way to experience the power of the East Tyrolean Alps is by hiking. The Outside Nature Hotel is an official hiking hotel located in the heart of the Hohe Tauern National Park. Find out more in our interview with hiking concierge Karin Steiner. Place of Power Matterhorn Switzerland’s most famous mountain, the Matterhorn, is also often described as a “place of power” – with no esoteric overtones. “The mountain is often seen as a place that gives people energy and inspiration,” reports the CERVO Mountain Resort in Zermatt. The nature-oriented design resort offers direct views of the Swiss landmark. Recharge your batteries with a forest bath in South Tyrol At the adults-only wellness hotel My Arbor*, the surrounding forest is mentioned. It not only provides “a picturesque backdrop for the hotel,” but also “a retreat full of peace and natural energy. My Arbor offers forest bathing at least once a week as part of its weekly program. “Forest bathing is a wonderful way to reduce stress, clear the mind and harmonize body and soul. The soothing effects of the trees and pure mountain air are appreciated by many of our guests.” – My Arbor The Riva Waterfalls in Sand in Taufers From the energy-self-sufficient OLM Nature Escape* in Sand in Taufers, South Tyrol, it is only a 30-minute walk to the Reinbach Waterfalls. These are three spectacular waterfalls in the Tauferer Ahrntal. The upper and middle ones are about 50 meters high and the lower one is over 10 meters high. According to OLM Nature Escape, the Reinbach Waterfalls are one of the most beautiful destinations in the area. Definitely an energizing place to recharge your batteries. The aparthotel itself is also a special place – the round building blends harmoniously into nature. Do places of power work? Many people visit a place of power and “recharge their batteries” – from nature, from pausing, from consciously pausing. There are scientists who are trying to scientifically prove the healing effects of nature (e.g. through forest bathing). There are already some indications, such as the reduction of stress hormones or a positive effect on the cardiovascular or immune system. However, we are talking about nature in general, not “places of power”. The most important thing is that both “official” and purely subjective places of power are always a personal feeling in the sense of “that does me good”, “that gives me strength.” Visitors to places of power do not need scientific proof of this. *CIN CODES Italien IT021072A1L46PNBHX (Hotel Weihrerhof) IT021072A1UOWUIDH4 (APIPURA hotel rinner) IT021011A1AE4737IT (My Arbor) IT021017B4CPKU6WK9 (OLM Nature Escape) Save this article as an inspiration for your next journey!"
5 accommodations for sustainable sleep in ancient masonry,"The more people around us, the more anonymous we feel. Sometimes we enjoy that anonymity, but when we’re staying in a hotel or vacationing, we like to be noticed. Do you feel the same way? Huge hotel complexes might have some amenities, like a few restaurants or shops on-site. But if you’re looking for a more private and intimate atmosphere, boutique hotels with just a few rooms are a better choice. In fact, at our smallest Green Hotel partner, La Casona in Peru, with just 11 rooms, you’ll feel like you’re staying with friends in Cusco. But what does “boutique” and “small” really mean? And are small hotels always more sustainable than large ones? Sustainable Hotels – Large vs. small Good, small, rural hotels and bad, big, urban hotels – sounds logical, doesn’t it? But it’s not that simple. We see this very clearly in the Green PearlsⓇ network: every type of hotel – large or small, in the city or in the country – can make its own contribution to sustainability. Are smaller hotels more sustainable than their larger counterparts? True, smaller hotels are often more sustainable or have an easier time becoming more sustainable. Many small hotels represent the personal visions of the owners, and many green pioneers have created their own hotels. For most of them, money is not everything. They are putting their heart and soul into their project, their life’s work. It is also easier to make changes in a small hotel with fewer rooms, fewer guests, and less logistical effort. Small hotels’ environmental advantages Big hotel – big impact On the other hand, when large hotels, or even an entire chain, embraces sustainable practices, it has a greater overall impact than a single small boutique hotel going green. An example? On the other hand, large hotels may take a long time to implement environmentally friendly measures (from soap dispensers to photovoltaic systems) due to the hierarchical structure of the company and the sheer number of rooms. 10 sustainable boutique hotels (11 to 38 rooms) – our recommendations Definition: Boutique hotels are characterized by the fact that they are personally and individually managed and are often found in the luxury segment. The maximum number of rooms is not precisely defined, but we use >40 rooms as a benchmark. #1 Casa León Royal Retreat, Gran Canaria, Spain (27 rooms) If you are looking for an authentic and sustainable way to experience the popular vacation island of Gran Canaria, Casa León Royal Retreat is the place to be. The small boutique hotel with pool is surrounded by a large garden with native plants. Almost all of the 27 rooms have panoramic windows with fantastic views. The hotel takes great pride in maintaining a neat and quiet atmosphere and offers a shuttle service several times a day to the beach, the city, or to one of the nearby golf courses. Sustainability: The German-speaking owner family is committed to the environment and has, for instance, leased a forest to offset the hotel’s CO2 emissions. There is also an advanced rainwater collection system, local food, and many other green initiatives. #2 Biohotel Grafenast, Tirol, Austria (23 rooms) It’s quaint and cozy at Biohotel Grafenast, which sits 1,300 meters above the Tyrolean Inn Valley. Some of the 23 rooms are specially designed for families, with separate children’s rooms, private terraces, and even private saunas. You can even rent a tiny house on the property. A vacation here is perfect for experiencing nature in the Tyrolean mountains (with winter sports during the season). The Bio Boutique Hotel also offers courses in yoga and fasting, as well as activities for children. A nature spa with forest sauna and hammam offers relaxation. Sustainability: The Unterlechner family’s small organic hotel looks back on over 100 years of family history. The hotel has been organic since the early 1980s. For Peter and Waltraud Unterlechner, organic and sustainability are part of their lifestyle, and protecting the environment is very important to them. #3 La Casona, Cusco, Peru (11 rooms) La Casona is a luxurious 5-star boutique hotel located in the ancient Inca city of Cusco and an excellent base for visiting Machu Picchu and other ancient Inca sites. In 2023, the hotel was awarded the Editor’s Choice Award in the “Remarkable Returns” category by the prestigious Hideaway Report. “In this 11-room retreat, guests feel as if they are in their own private villa in Cusco,” wrote the critics. Art lovers will appreciate the restored original frescoes in the rooms of the 500-year-old building. Sustainability: La Casona belongs to our Green PearlsⓇ partner Inkaterra, a pioneer of sustainability in Peru. The owner family has already implemented numerous environmental initiatives, such as water conservation and biodiversity (butterflies, orchids), and is involved in social projects. #4 Relais del Maro, Liguria, Italy (14 rooms) The Relais del Maro is located in the picturesque village of Borgomaro, in the heart of Liguria, and is warmly run by owner Elena Scalambrin. She and her parents set up the boutique hotel as an Albergo Diffuso. Meaning that you’ll find the 14 rooms in several historic buildings (former family homes and business premises). Sustainability: By building the Albergo Diffuso, Elena has made a significant contribution to the preservation of the Italian village. Not only has she found new uses for vacant buildings, but she has also revitalized the last remaining businesses such as the bakery, restaurant, and hairdresser. In addition, the family and local craftsmen lovingly restored the rooms, in some cases using historic techniques. #5 Keemala, Phuket, Thailand (38 rooms) The 38 luxurious pool villas are nestled in the treetops of a tropical Phuket forest overlooking the ocean. Within the forest, which has been preserved as much as possible, is the resort’s own fruit, vegetable, and herb garden. A cooking class will teach you about the local plants and how to harvest and prepare fresh fruits and vegetables. Sustainability: The Somnam family built the resort without any major impact on the environment and it follows an exemplary zero-waste concept. The siblings Samornpun and Tanapong (known as Tarn and Note) Somnam are very close to nature and thus invite you to explore the “magical forest” barefoot during their yoga retreats. #6 Hotel Bella Vista, Zermatt, Switzerland (21 rooms) In car-free Zermatt, Switzerland, the Hotel Bella Vista is located just above the town center with a fantastic view of the Matterhorn. In winter it is right next to a ski slope, and in summer the hiking trails start right outside the front door. The Anthamatten family is running the hotel and offers a warm and welcoming atmosphere. Dogs are also welcome. Sustainability:
Furnishings are made from local wood and natural materials. You will also get to taste local organic food. The host family is very close to nature and tries to find the most sustainable solution for all decisions. #7 Waldhotel Fletschhorn, Saas-Fee, Switzerland (13 rooms) Established in 1906, the Waldhotel Fletschhorn is an oasis of peace amidst the snow-capped peaks of the surrounding four-thousanders. You can have breakfast at your convenience with fresh organic ingredients (without the famous “battle at the buffet”). A fresh coffee or tea, prepared with water from the hotel’s own mountain spring, rounds your breakfast off. All 13 rooms have a balcony or terrace. The boutique hotel is famous for its à la carte dinners, and each course comes with a wine pairing. Sustainability: In addition to fresh spring water and green electricity, the Waldhotel engages in projects regarding animal welfare, the environment, and social commitment. The culinary concept includes the use of regional organic products. #8 Hôtel Le Pavillon, Paris, France (15 rooms) Located in the central 7th district of Paris, the small Hôtel Le Pavillon is in the heart of the French capital. The most famous sights such as the Eiffel Tower or the Louvre are within walking distance. The German speaking owners have decorated their small hotel in an artistic and individual way and also offer rooms shielded from electro smog. The hotel also has revitalized water and special room air filters. PS: Hôtel Le Pavillon is a member of the Green Spirit Hotels Paris network, along with Hôtel Malar and Hôtel Amélie. Sustainability: The hotel was built from an existing building (a former convent) and focuses on organic products for breakfast and reducing waste. The owners and staff will be happy to give you insider tips on alternative places (e.g. vintage shops, weekly markets or a repair café) where you can experience the metropolis in a sustainable way. #9 Strandhaus Boutique Resort & Spa, Spreewald, Germany (20 rooms) The Strandhaus Boutique Resort & Spa has an inviting location, surrounded by the arms of the Spree River. Boat rides start right outside the door. The hotel with only 20 rooms has a wellness area, a beach café, a restaurant (with authentic Spreewald cuisine), a library, and a beautiful garden with a green beach directly at the river. Sustainability: The hotel supports youth welfare, a kindergarten, and the local shooting club in Lübben. It also employs local staff. In general, the Strandhaus is a place where regionalism and the preservation of traditions are very important. Food comes from local farmers and some is growing in the hotel’s own garden. #10 Farmhouse Smiling Gecko, Kampong Chhnang Province, Cambodia (34 Rooms) At the Farmhouse Smiling Gecko you can stay in bungalows on stilts (with terraces and rain showers) or in one of the rooms in the Khmer House. There are a total of 34 rooms in 17 houses – the pool with sundeck or the restaurant serve as common meeting points. The unique feature: The Farmhouse is not just a luxury resort – it is a non-profit project! The Smiling Gecko Project supports the rural people of Cambodia to help themselves. People learn various trades in training centers, and 40 Cambodians are permanently working at the Farmhouse at an above-average salary. Sustainability: In addition to social sustainability, you can also experience the farm-to-table concept here. Meaning that the food comes directly from their own organic gardens and the surrounding agriculture. Hotel categorization by number of rooms The average hotel has about 150 rooms. As our analysis of available statistics shows, there are slightly fewer in Germany and Italy, and slightly more in Dubai. If you search the Internet to find out how many rooms a small, large, or medium-sized hotel has, you will find a wide variety of values. So here is our own definition: According to Green PearlsⓇ, you can divide hotels into the following categories: < 30 rooms: small hotel < 40 rooms: boutique hotel 40 to 100 rooms: midsize hotel 100 to 150 rooms: larger hotel >150 rooms: large hotel Finally, we would like to know your opinion – do you prefer to stay in large or small hotels? What size room do you think is ideal? Tell us in the comments! And don’t forget to save this article for your next travel planning!"
5 accommodations for sustainable sleep in ancient masonry,"“Retirement at last! Now I finally have the time for vacations.” Today’s retirees are fit, well-educated, and eager to travel – and many of them have a sustainable outlook. Some have been for a long time (like the “old 68ers” or the founders of the eco-movement in the 1980s). Others have realized that we need to rethink in times of global warming, resource scarcity, and population explosion. “You don’t want bad karma at the end of your life,” my father (71) often says. People travel differently as they age Retirees don’t feel “old” in the traditional sense. But they certainly don’t want to take the kind of vacation they would have taken when they were 20. Hitchhiking, sharing rooms, eating bad and cheap food… when you’re young, you do a lot to stretch your limited financial resources. Young parents, on the other hand, put their children first in their travel plans. There should be children’s programs, playgrounds, water slides, fries and other children. But if you’re not in that stage of life, you can probably skip the mini-club, teen disco, and screaming kids on vacation. That doesn’t mean you don’t like kids! Maybe you even have grandchildren and love them more than anything? But does that mean you have to spend your vacation in a “kid-friendly hotel”? Of course not! Everyone has their own travel priorities, and we want to help you prepare so you can find the vacation that works for you – now. 7 Green Rules for Silver Nomads In April 2024, the British travel magazine Condé Nast Traveler created the “Golden Rules for Retirement Travel”. The 17 rules are based on interviews with frequent travelers, such as the blogger behind Traveling Black Widow, who has visited more than 100 countries. However, they did not consider sustainability specifically. We think though, that this is an important consideration for travelers of all ages. So we’ve come up with seven green rules. And if you’re worried about sacrificing amenities, let us reassure you: Fun, authentic experiences, and relaxation go hand in hand with sustainability! Slow Travel Time is the great luxury of retirement, and you should make the most of it! Instead of driving twelve hours in one day, try to make it three days and include some interesting stops. Also, take your time when you get to your destination, and do not cram too many activities into your itinerary. It’s better for you and the environment. Sustainable Journey Traveling to faraway countries has the biggest impact on the carbon footprint of your trip. However, we do not believe that people should stop flying. As tourism is an important source of income for many countries, and this is how wealth is distributed. Read more about this in our blog post “Are we still allowed to fly”. If you do travel long distances, make sure it is for an extended stay and avoid domestic flights or flights within Europe. Traveling by train is a good alternative. Pack and plan ahead for your special needs One of Condé Nast Traveller’s golden rules is: “BYOTP” (Bring Your Own Toilet Paper). We want to expand on this tip because we know from various Best Agers that their own “quirks” simply become more important over time. Some people bring their own toilet paper, others their reading lamp, extra towel hooks for the bathroom, a travel kettle, an iron, a yoga mat, clothes hangers… If you’re the kind of person who’s annoyed every day on vacation when you don’t have certain things, it’s best to bring them yourself – or ask your accommodation if they can provide them! Pack light Although we recommend that you bring important “extras” with you, you should still try to pack light in general. Light weight and volume are not only better for the environment, but also more comfortable when boarding trains, etc. Retired travel professionals have created a “travel wardrobe” over the years with a capsule wardrobe that can be easily combined. Book appropriate and sustainable accommodations Sustainably managed accommodations focus on green energy, local organic food, fair treatment of employees, waste reduction, and community involvement. In this way, you can make a positive impact while you travel. Learn a few words of the local language “Hello”, “Thank you”, and “Please” – even the simplest phrases are received positively and make you more popular as a guest. Do not procrastinate Your experience of life has surely shown you that nothing is certain. If you were healthy yesterday, you could be sick tomorrow. Or there could be a pandemic, war, or natural disaster – and suddenly travel is no longer possible. So take advantage of the opportunity to travel when it presents itself. Whether you are retired or nearing it! Visa requirements and international health insurance for retirees Sustainable Adults-Only Hotels in Europe Back to the hotels without kids clubs and waterslides. Adults-only hotels have become a global trend. Here, the emphasis is on tranquility, and you will find creative, multi-course delicacies on your dinner plate. The focus is on peace and relaxation. Sounds perfect for you? Then let us introduce you to some sustainable adults-only hotels in Italy, Spain and Germany: #1 LA VIMEA, Italy, South Tyrol – Vegan hotel with daily yoga Located in Naturns, LA VIMEA, with its natural swimming pond, barrel sauna, and e-bike rental, is a wonderful place to relax. The adults-only hotel offers a natural atmosphere and daily yoga. The hotel also offers Ayurvedic medicine and treatments. Another special feature is the cuisine, which is exclusively vegan. #2 My Arbor, Italy, South Tyrol – Exceptional wellness hotel on stilts My Arbor near Brixen stands on stilts directly in the forest and offers a wonderful view of the Plose. The area is known for its moderate hills, which offer excellent hiking opportunities for all ages and fitness levels. There is a large spa area with pools, saunas and massage rooms. My Arbor also offers “me-time“. Meaning, the adults-only hotel has a concept of making everything just the way you want it and tailoring the hotel to your needs. For example, you can have breakfast until 2 p.m! #3 Lifestylehotel SAND, Germany, Schleswig-Holstein – A natural and relaxing vacation Light, sandy colors, natural materials, COCO-MAT beds and a special attention to detail – these are the hallmarks of the adults-only Lifestylehotel SAND. Located in Timmendorfer Strand, directly on the beach of the Baltic Sea, the hotel has a charm all year round. A highlight of the hotel is the roof terrace with sauna and deck chairs – a wonderful place to relax. #4 Casa León Royal Retreat, Spain, Gran Canaria – Enjoy and recharge your batteries On a vacation island as popular as Gran Canaria, you should pay special attention to finding the right sustainable hotel (without a youth disco). The small boutique hotel Casa León Royal Retreat is located in the interior of the island, far away from the beach resorts of Maspalomas. Lovingly run by the German-speaking owner family, the hotel with pool and gardens has only 27 rooms. Sports activities include tennis, aquagym, yoga, hiking and regular (free) shuttles to nearby golf courses or the beach. #5 Naturresort Gerbehof, Germany, Lake Constance – Adults Only outside school holidays There are two different times at Gerbehof Nature Resort. A family time, where children are welcome and offered an appropriate program, and a time reserved for adults, where peace and quiet are the order of the day. The nature resort near Lake Constance is surrounded by the famous apple trees. A feast for the eyes, especially when they are in bloom. If you are a follower of the Philippi Method (bioenergetic meditations and treatments according to Viktor Philippi), you will be happy to know that it is a main focus of the hotel. #6 STURM, Germany, Rhön – Relaxation in nature The Rhön, a low mountain range in Germany, is partly a UNESCO Biosphere Reserve and offers a beautiful landscape of forests, basalt peaks, and moors. The STURM is located in Mellrichstadt at the foot of the Rhön. Although not a designated Adults Only hotel, the new garden view rooms overlooking the hotel’s natural swimming pond can be booked by adults only. The rooms, made of natural materials, were designed by German architect Matthias Loebermann, who won the “best architects award” for this project in 2023. Green PearlsⓇ Accommodation for Golden Agers outside Europe There are also sustainable Green PearlsⓇ partners outside of Europe we can recommend to travelers in the 60+ age group. #1 La Casona, Peru, Cusco – Discover the treasures of the Incas The Andean region of Peru is one of the most fascinating areas on the planet. As we report in our Green Travel Guide to the Andes, due to the altitude of over 3000 meters, you should allow a few days for acclimatization before starting your sightseeing program with Machu Picchu and other sites from the Inca era. An excellent starting point is the ancient Inca capital of Cusco. The luxurious boutique hotel Inkaterra La Casona is located in a former Spanish colonial mansion. It stands on a former training ground for the Inca army. The rooms feature restored original frescoes and Inkaterra provides expert local guides. #2 Pavilions Himalayas – The Farm, Nepal – Safari Tours and Authentic Nepal Another place where Silver Nomads should feel right at home is the boutique resort Pavilions Himalayas – The Farm. It consists of 15 Nepalese-style villas and the owners originally established it to introduce local farmers to organic farming. Surrounded by breathtaking scenery with views of the Himalayas, you will find time for guided yoga and meditation classes, temple excursions, and wildlife safaris. Accommodations such as Inkaterra La Casona and Pavilions Himalayas offer luxurious amenities for sustainable (long-distance) retirement travel while also committing to sustainability. They strive to preserve both cultural heritage and nature for their grandchildren and great-grandchildren through various projects (see Inkaterra Acociatión).

Peru: From the rain forest to the cloud forest and Machu Picchu,"A relaxing vacation means “lying on a deck chair and doing nothing,” right? Wrong. Studies show actively pursuing a hobby can help you feel more relaxed, positive, and actually less prone to illness as you age. Statista’s latest data, published in February 2024, shows the most popular hobbies to pursue during your “hobbydays” (instead of “Holidays”). It looked at the most popular hobbies in 13 countries around the world, and we will tell you more about them. Why hobbies boost happiness Having a hobby is linked to long-term happiness in old age. That’s the result of a global study conducted in 2023. The London-based UCL Institute of Epidemiology & Health Care surveyed 90,000 people in 16 countries (Europe, USA, Japan, China) and found that: People who have a hobby experience a decrease in depressive symptoms and an increase in life satisfaction and happiness. According to neuroscientist Ciara McCabe, a professor at the University of Reading, many hobbies also improve our health and prevent disease. Playing a musical instrument improves memory, while reading as well as playing board games helps prevent dementia in later life. So, it’s not just the well-known “health hobbies” like fitness, walking or yoga that promote good health, but also crafts and games. A hobby traveler’s hotel Science suggests that the left hemisphere of the brain processes logical and rational thinking, while the right hemisphere processes emotional and creative thinking. “The vast majority of pursuits and hobbies are about getting the left brain to shut up.” British PR guru Matthew Freud says. The producer has recently ventured into the hotel business, opening an experimental luxury hotel for hobby travelers. At The Bull in Burford, UK, guests are encouraged to take up hobbies. There’s a book club, photography workshops, chess, yoga classes, gardening… not participating is like going to a restaurant and not eating. But the focus of the hotel is on luxury and community, not sustainability. Moreover, if you study lists of the most popular hobbies in different countries, not all of them are environmentally friendly (e.g., motorcycling or recreational flying). What are the most popular hobbies around the world? We looked at lists from different countries (13 in total) to determine the most popular hobbies. Interesting: In 5 countries (including Switzerland and India), “traveling” is the number one hobby. Also among the top hobbies are: However, there are several surveys with different results regarding hobbies. For example, according to Statista, the “most common leisure activity” of Germans is gardening. Not mentioned anywhere is stamp collecting, which I used to do as a kid (it’s incredible how you can feel so old at the age of 41 🙂 ). Sustainable hobbies for your Hobbydays What hobbies do you have? Or what hobbies would you like to have? If you want to spend some Hobbydays (we had to bring in that gurky pun again). We have some nice ideas for you. Just trying a hobby once on holiday can “kickstart our reward system and subsequently our motivation to do the hobby again,” says Professor Ciara McCabe, an Associate Professor of Neuroscience in the Department of Psychology at the University of Reading. Sustainability depends on how many resources your hobby uses and how you practice it. Reading is more sustainable if you buy used books, and exercise is more sustainable if it is done without electronics or sports facility (e.g. trail running instead of track running). A sustainable cooking class can teach you how to cook without waste, and a craft class can bring items back to life by upcycling them instead of buying new (and usually less sustainable) materials just for a craft idea. Below you will find a selection of hobbies we covered on the Green Travel Blog, along with the corresponding “Hobbyday” accommodation. In addition, you will find out about sustainability in each article – just click on the picture! Did we forget to mention a hobby? Probably! Tell us in the comments about your hobbies and how the perfect Hobbydays would look for you. Save the article on Pinterest so you can find it again and again!"
Peru: From the rain forest to the cloud forest and Machu Picchu,"This is the second part of our Peru Travel Guide. In the first part, we provided important information on how to prepare for a sustainable trip to Peru and described the sights in the Andes and in the south (i.e. Machu Picchu to Lake Titicaca). In addition to the fascinating mountains, in Peru you have the opportunity to experience a real jungle adventure in the Amazon rainforest. You can expect almost daily afternoon rains, very high humidity, high temperatures and extremely dense vegetation. You will find more species of plants and animals here than anywhere else on earth. Sustainable hotels in Peru: Inkaterra at the forefront of green tourism‘ To experience Peru sustainably, you should pay special attention to your choice of accommodation. Instead of staying in a hotel blog, which has a huge impact on the environment, produces mountains of packaging waste, and may exploit workers, look for smaller, owner-managed accommodations or homestays. For something more luxurious (even in the jungle), we recommend Inkaterra Hotels. They run seven properties, four of which are Green PearlsⓇ partners. Inkaterra’s history The founder of Inkaterra, José Koechlin von Stein, is a member of the Koechlin family. They came to Peru from Alsace in 1852 and have been rooted here for generations. In 1975, José purchased the first piece of land on which he built the Inkaterra Reserva Amazónica. In addition, he founded the non-profit Inkaterra Asociación to protect the environment and species, preserving Peru’s cultural treasures and raw materials, and supporting the local population. “Sustainable travel is (…) he most effective way to raise awareness on our planet’s natural resources. Only when travelling we get to know local cultures and natural environments. We learn about their uniqueness as well as their fragility, and then we are engaged to their preservation for future generations to come..” – José Koechlin von Stein in an Interview with Sustainable Leaders Inkaterra Asociación’s successful projects When you choose to stay with Inkaterra Authentic Nature Travel, you are also indirectly supporting their projects. These include: Sustainable vacation in the Amazon At all Inkaterra hotels, highly trained local guides will accompany you and show you the natural beauty and cultural treasures of the country. Tip: If bird watching is your thing, take a birding tour with Hiroshi Sánchez at Inkaterra Hacienda Urubamba. He has a passion for birds, and you can learn a lot from him! The jungle is nature and life – unlike the desert, where you see vast lands, there is life in abundance! It’s loud, it’s growing, it’s moving, it’s green, it’s sprouting. A canopy walk takes you right under the canopy where monkeys leap, birds fly, and fascinating insects sit on the leaves all around you. The small “tropical house” you may know from the zoo is nothing compared to the real jungle with its colors and sounds. All the more frightening that rainforests are disappearing from our planet. A trip to the rainforest (without lighting fires, hunting animals, or damaging nature in any other way) will surely inspire you to do more for the green lungs of our planet. For example, it is important to avoid the use of tropical wood (watch out for barbecue charcoal), and the use of aluminum, etc. is also related to the protection of the rainforest. Read more about this in this Insight. Preparing for your Rainforest Tour The Tambopata National Reserve – adjacent to Inkaterra’s Reserva Amazonica and the Amazon Field Station of Inkaterra – recommends the following preparation: Packing List for the Jungle Sustainable journey to the rainforest of Peru The Amazon region around the Amazon River is an entirely different side of the country. Many people fly into the jungle in small planes. A flight from Cusco takes about 2 hours 40 minutes and doesn’t cost much (about 100 to 300 Euros). However, it is more sustainable to take the bus. It takes much longer (about 10 hours), but it is much cheaper (about 20 to 50 Euros), more environmentally friendly, and you get a special experience of the country. It is also possible to follow the slow travel principle and discover a lot on the trip itself by splitting the route. Between Cusco and Iquitos, for example, you could spend a day in the Reserva Nacional Pacaya Samiria. The largest nature reserve in Peru, it is home to fascinating flora and fauna. Slow travel also has the advantage of allowing you to get used to the new climate. 🙂 Green sights – the Amazon rainforest in Peru The jungle is the natural habitat for approximately two-thirds of all animals and plants on our planet. In fact, there are probably millions of species yet to be discovered! It is home to colorful macaws and many species of monkeys, such as howler and squirrel monkeys. What you may not realize is that in many places, the jungle floor is inaccessible to humans. It is so densely overgrown that sunlight cannot reach the ground, leaving you in total darkness. Only enter the jungle with a knowledgeable jungle guide. Sustainable accommodation: Inkaterra Reserva Amazónica At Inkaterra Reserva Amazónica in the Tambopata region, you will find experienced English-speaking guides. This is where Inkaterra began, and you will stay in naturally designed guest rooms and suites with hammocks and mosquito nets. Experience the jungle with expert guides on ropes courses, boat trips, and trails. There are also regular nature lectures. Tip: If you like, you can even spend the night in a treehouse! Read more in our article about treehouse hotels. Conclusion – Peru: The trip of a lifetime Peru is an extraodinary place. A country with over 2,000 kilometers of coastline, desert, snow-capped 6,000-meter mountains, and jungle. Here you will meet incredibly friendly people and see animals such as penguins, sea lions, condors, macaw parrots, monkeys, and guanacos (the wild alpacas) in the wild. Peru is a colorful mix of Inca history, indigenous culture, colonial heritage, and modern nation-state. You will find luxury and poverty, but most of all hospitality, natural beauty, and closeness to nature. A trip to Peru will make you marvel at the treasures of our planet – and perhaps motivate you to preserve them for the future. Save this article for your Peru trip!"
Peru: From the rain forest to the cloud forest and Machu Picchu,"Peru is undoubtedly one of the most fascinating countries in South America. Wherever you go, you will discover cultural and natural treasures that cannot be found anywhere else in the world. To preserve them, we ask ourselves how a trip like this can be made sustainable. After all, we want to avoid disturbing sites like the ancient Inca city of Machu Picchu. The ruins have already been forced to close in 2023 due to erosion caused by too many visitors. Here you will find important tips and addresses for an environmentally friendly and respectful stay and, of course, many recommendations for travel regions, sights and activities. The first part covers The second part deals with 11 tips to travel sustainably in Peru Mobility Planning your Trip In Peru Acclimatization in Peru – Reasons, tips and prevention Before we get to the country’s attractions, there is another important thing to consider: acclimatization. Depending on where you come from (e.g. Europe, North America or the Middle East), Peru’s climate will be very different from the one you are used to. It can take some time to adjust, and you should take this into account when preparing for your trip (and don’t take it lightly!). Mountain acclimatization in Peru The Andes are the longest and highest mountain range in South America and include numerous six-thousand-meter peaks. (The highest mountain in Peru is Nevado Huascarán at 6,768 meters). Above 2,400 meters, the air pressure is 25% lower than at sea level. Your body will need to adjust. If you ascend to high altitudes too quickly, you run the risk of altitude sickness (headache, dizziness, nausea, etc.). If you are traveling to Peru, you may want to start at lower altitudes to give your body a few days to adjust to the air. First Machu Picchu, then Cusco Machu Picchu is located at 2,400 meters and is the lowest point in the Cusco region. This makes Machu Picchu the perfect starting point for exploring the Inca cities. Here you will find the Inkaterra Machu Picchu Pueblo Hotel, which we will introduce later. Cusco itself is located at an altitude of 3,300 meters, the air pressure here is about 33% lower than at sea level, but if you have gotten a little used to the high altitude air beforehand, you should have no problems here. Precautions against altitude sickness The cuisine of Peru To discover Peru sustainably, be sure to try the local food! You can buy fresh produce cheaply at the markets, as well as local street food and in great little restaurants. If you want to impress the Andean farmers, you can practice peeling potatoes at home. Many different types of potatoes are eaten here, and a good bride who is new to her in-laws must prove that she can peel even the “difficult” potatoes. 🙂 There are also a few specialties that may not be for everyone, such as ceviche (raw fish) or cuy (guinea pig), as well as many deliciously spiced bean and rice dishes or cornmeal desserts that are suitable for vegetarian travelers. Discover the sights of the Cusco region in a sustainable way As mentioned in the beginning, Peru has a wealth of sights and contrasts that you wouldn’t find in any other country! A desert by the sea, the famous Rainbow Mountains, cultural treasures of the Incas – there is so much to see that we can only highlight some of the main attractions. Of course, we have chosen them (randomly, as always ;-)) in the vicinity of our Green PearlsⓇ partners. Machu Picchu Who would travel to Peru without seeing the UNESCO World Heritage Site with their own eyes? Just climbing up to the ruins of the former Inca city amidst the mountains is so magical and fantastic that it’s thoroughly different from, say, visiting the pyramids in Cairo. You can reach Machu Picchu either by bus or on foot with a guide on the Inca Trail. Machu Picchu in high or low season? According to the Machu Picchu Center, the busiest months are June, July and August. This is mainly because many people go on vacation during this time, and it is also the dry season. This means a good chance of getting fog-free photos – but also plenty of other tourists. It is more sustainable to travel in the off-season. This would be By taking advantage of the rainy season, you help spread out the crowds over the year, giving nature more time to regenerate. Water conservation, waste management, etc. can simply be better managed if tourism is spread out rather than rushed over a few months. In addition, November to April is known as “orchid season” in Peru and is the best time to see the unique orchid collection at Inkaterra Machu Picchu Pueblo Hotel in full bloom. Sustainable accommodation: Inkaterra Machu Picchu Pueblo Hotel The hotel is located near the train station (eco-friendly travel) and was built as a small village with local materials in the style of Andean villages. Surrounding the rooms is a large estate with several charming trails allowing you to observe orchids (372 species of native orchids), birds (214 species) and butterflies (111 species). Cusco – the former capital of the Incas Cusco was the former capital of the Incas and considered itself the center of the world. You should visit the city if you want to delve deeper into the history of the Incas. Cusco also offers many colorful markets and tourist amenities such as Wi-Fi hotspots, ATMs, a tourist information office and good bus service. Sustainable accommodation in Cusco: Inkaterra La Casona In Cusco, Inkaterra operates a luxurious hideaway in a restored 16th century mansion. Inkaterra La Casona consists of just 11 suites in the heart of the vibrant city. In addition to antique furniture, you will find restored frescoes on the walls, some of which are 500 years old. The boutique hotel is an excellent base for exploring the Cusco region, as most tours start here. Recommended reading for the Cusco area Inkaterra has recommended a few books in English to read before or during your trip: Accommodation in the Sacred Valley: Inkaterra Hacienda Urubamba Inkaterra Hacienda Urubamba is also located in the Cusco region. This hotel is located in the “Sacred Valley” between shimmering reddish mountains. The “holiness” probably comes from the fact that Urubamba is the most fertile valley in all of Peru and is therefore considered particularly “blessed”. It is ideal for family vacations and offers many opportunities for a gentle nature vacation. Inkaterra also allows you to meet and support local artisans and farmers. Ruins of Ollantaytambo and the Salt Terraces of Maras From Cusco, you can take day trips to many other Inca cities. After Machu Picchu, the most famous are the ruins of Ollantaytambo and the salt terraces of Maras. Rainbow Mountains You should also visit the Rainbow Mountains if you are in the Cusco area – regular buses leave from Cusco itself. Please note – many leave at 3am, and you will need good shoes and a good level of fitness. The Rainbow Mountains, at an altitude of about 4,000 meters, are striking for their magnificent colors. Combined with the mountain panorama they offer a fantastic nature experience and the trip is definitely worthwhile – but it is no longer an insider tip and with about 600 visitors per day it already falls into the category of mass tourism. Southwestern Peru Sights The south and southwest of Peru are for the most part desert. The Nazca Lines, visible from the sky, are famous and remain a mystery. However, visiting them from the ground is not as spectacular (as you cannot see them) and we do not recommend booking a flight over them for sustainability reasons. Many documentary filmmakers have done this for us and explained in their movies what the lines are all about! There are also many other great sights that you reach much more sustainably 😉 Paracas National Reserve – wildlife watching The Paracas Peninsula and the Islas Ballestas are an absolute highlight for many Peru travelers. They are part of a nature reserve and offer a unique natural environment with a mixture of desert and sea. On a boat tour, you can see seals, penguins, dolphins and seabirds. The reserve is located in the southwest of Peru, about 460 kilometers from Cusco. Colca Canyon – Valley of the Condors In the Colca Canyon you can see condors flying overhead. It is one of the largest birds of prey in the world. Its wingspan can be up to 3 meters, which is quite impressive! It belongs to the family of vultures, more specifically the New World vultures. For those looking for an exciting place to hike, the Colca Canyon is definitely an experience! And if you usually have the problem that you can’t see birds in the treetops – it’s not difficult here! (Because of their size, you can’t miss them – caption) 🙂 Lake Titicaca – Souvenirs from Uros Not only does Lake Titicaca have a super cool name, but it is also beautiful. The lake sits on a plateau at nearly 4,000 meters and borders Bolivia on the other side of the water. At Lake Titicaca, you can not only go boating and swimming (if you don’t mind the cold) but also learn about the culture of the Urus. They still live on floating islands, they build themselves out of totora reeds. Such an island lasts about 50 years and is continuously maintained by the Urus. In the past, the tribe lived mainly from fishing, but nowadays, tourism is an important source of income. Meaning you are now directly addressed. 🙂 You can buy all kinds of colorful things from them, such as handmade windchimes, hats, bowls, rugs, dolls, boats, necklaces, and so on. The ideal place to stock up on souvenirs for the long haul. Sustainability in Peru – Connecting with Pachamama (Mother Earth) Most of the 55 or so indigenous ethnic groups live in the Amazon region. Only four groups belong to the so-called Andean peoples. They have a special connection to the goddess Pachamama (Mother Earth) and everything that comes from her. Therefore, they focus their lives on creating a balance between different forces, practicing work, prayers, and rituals in harmony and gratitude with Mother Earth. Tip: If you travel to Peru in August, you can participate in a “Pay the Earth” ceremony that takes place throughout the country during that month. You should make sure that you don’t fall into a “tourist trap”, but support the local population as directly as possible! Even if we have no religious or spiritual connection to Pachamama, we should still try to appreciate and protect nature when we travel. This is true not only when traveling to and in Peru, but all over the world. Save this article for your planning!"
5 accommodations for sustainable sleep in ancient masonry,"The more people around us, the more anonymous we feel. Sometimes we enjoy that anonymity, but when we’re staying in a hotel or vacationing, we like to be noticed. Do you feel the same way? Huge hotel complexes might have some amenities, like a few restaurants or shops on-site. But if you’re looking for a more private and intimate atmosphere, boutique hotels with just a few rooms are a better choice. In fact, at our smallest Green Hotel partner, La Casona in Peru, with just 11 rooms, you’ll feel like you’re staying with friends in Cusco. But what does “boutique” and “small” really mean? And are small hotels always more sustainable than large ones? Sustainable Hotels – Large vs. small Good, small, rural hotels and bad, big, urban hotels – sounds logical, doesn’t it? But it’s not that simple. We see this very clearly in the Green PearlsⓇ network: every type of hotel – large or small, in the city or in the country – can make its own contribution to sustainability. Are smaller hotels more sustainable than their larger counterparts? True, smaller hotels are often more sustainable or have an easier time becoming more sustainable. Many small hotels represent the personal visions of the owners, and many green pioneers have created their own hotels. For most of them, money is not everything. They are putting their heart and soul into their project, their life’s work. It is also easier to make changes in a small hotel with fewer rooms, fewer guests, and less logistical effort. Small hotels’ environmental advantages Big hotel – big impact On the other hand, when large hotels, or even an entire chain, embraces sustainable practices, it has a greater overall impact than a single small boutique hotel going green. An example? On the other hand, large hotels may take a long time to implement environmentally friendly measures (from soap dispensers to photovoltaic systems) due to the hierarchical structure of the company and the sheer number of rooms. 10 sustainable boutique hotels (11 to 38 rooms) – our recommendations Definition: Boutique hotels are characterized by the fact that they are personally and individually managed and are often found in the luxury segment. The maximum number of rooms is not precisely defined, but we use >40 rooms as a benchmark. #1 Casa León Royal Retreat, Gran Canaria, Spain (27 rooms) If you are looking for an authentic and sustainable way to experience the popular vacation island of Gran Canaria, Casa León Royal Retreat is the place to be. The small boutique hotel with pool is surrounded by a large garden with native plants. Almost all of the 27 rooms have panoramic windows with fantastic views. The hotel takes great pride in maintaining a neat and quiet atmosphere and offers a shuttle service several times a day to the beach, the city, or to one of the nearby golf courses. Sustainability: The German-speaking owner family is committed to the environment and has, for instance, leased a forest to offset the hotel’s CO2 emissions. There is also an advanced rainwater collection system, local food, and many other green initiatives. #2 Biohotel Grafenast, Tirol, Austria (23 rooms) It’s quaint and cozy at Biohotel Grafenast, which sits 1,300 meters above the Tyrolean Inn Valley. Some of the 23 rooms are specially designed for families, with separate children’s rooms, private terraces, and even private saunas. You can even rent a tiny house on the property. A vacation here is perfect for experiencing nature in the Tyrolean mountains (with winter sports during the season). The Bio Boutique Hotel also offers courses in yoga and fasting, as well as activities for children. A nature spa with forest sauna and hammam offers relaxation. Sustainability: The Unterlechner family’s small organic hotel looks back on over 100 years of family history. The hotel has been organic since the early 1980s. For Peter and Waltraud Unterlechner, organic and sustainability are part of their lifestyle, and protecting the environment is very important to them. #3 La Casona, Cusco, Peru (11 rooms) La Casona is a luxurious 5-star boutique hotel located in the ancient Inca city of Cusco and an excellent base for visiting Machu Picchu and other ancient Inca sites. In 2023, the hotel was awarded the Editor’s Choice Award in the “Remarkable Returns” category by the prestigious Hideaway Report. “In this 11-room retreat, guests feel as if they are in their own private villa in Cusco,” wrote the critics. Art lovers will appreciate the restored original frescoes in the rooms of the 500-year-old building. Sustainability: La Casona belongs to our Green PearlsⓇ partner Inkaterra, a pioneer of sustainability in Peru. The owner family has already implemented numerous environmental initiatives, such as water conservation and biodiversity (butterflies, orchids), and is involved in social projects. #4 Relais del Maro, Liguria, Italy (14 rooms) The Relais del Maro is located in the picturesque village of Borgomaro, in the heart of Liguria, and is warmly run by owner Elena Scalambrin. She and her parents set up the boutique hotel as an Albergo Diffuso. Meaning that you’ll find the 14 rooms in several historic buildings (former family homes and business premises). Sustainability: By building the Albergo Diffuso, Elena has made a significant contribution to the preservation of the Italian village. Not only has she found new uses for vacant buildings, but she has also revitalized the last remaining businesses such as the bakery, restaurant, and hairdresser. In addition, the family and local craftsmen lovingly restored the rooms, in some cases using historic techniques. #5 Keemala, Phuket, Thailand (38 rooms) The 38 luxurious pool villas are nestled in the treetops of a tropical Phuket forest overlooking the ocean. Within the forest, which has been preserved as much as possible, is the resort’s own fruit, vegetable, and herb garden. A cooking class will teach you about the local plants and how to harvest and prepare fresh fruits and vegetables. Sustainability: The Somnam family built the resort without any major impact on the environment and it follows an exemplary zero-waste concept. The siblings Samornpun and Tanapong (known as Tarn and Note) Somnam are very close to nature and thus invite you to explore the “magical forest” barefoot during their yoga retreats. #6 Hotel Bella Vista, Zermatt, Switzerland (21 rooms) In car-free Zermatt, Switzerland, the Hotel Bella Vista is located just above the town center with a fantastic view of the Matterhorn. In winter it is right next to a ski slope, and in summer the hiking trails start right outside the front door. The Anthamatten family is running the hotel and offers a warm and welcoming atmosphere.

Furnishings are made from local wood and natural materials. You will also get to taste local organic food. The host family is very close to nature and tries to find the most sustainable solution for all decisions. #7 Waldhotel Fletschhorn, Saas-Fee, Switzerland (13 rooms) Established in 1906, the Waldhotel Fletschhorn is an oasis of peace amidst the snow-capped peaks of the surrounding four-thousanders. You can have breakfast at your convenience with fresh organic ingredients (without the famous “battle at the buffet”). A fresh coffee or tea, prepared with water from the hotel’s own mountain spring, rounds your breakfast off. All 13 rooms have a balcony or terrace. The boutique hotel is famous for its à la carte dinners, and each course comes with a wine pairing. Sustainability: In addition to fresh spring water and green electricity, the Waldhotel engages in projects regarding animal welfare, the environment, and social commitment. The culinary concept includes the use of regional organic products. #8 Hôtel Le Pavillon, Paris, France (15 rooms) Located in the central 7th district of Paris, the small Hôtel Le Pavillon is in the heart of the French capital. The most famous sights such as the Eiffel Tower or the Louvre are within walking distance. The German speaking owners have decorated their small hotel in an artistic and individual way and also offer rooms shielded from electro smog. The hotel also has revitalized water and special room air filters. PS: Hôtel Le Pavillon is a member of the Green Spirit Hotels Paris network, along with Hôtel Malar and Hôtel Amélie. Sustainability: The hotel was built from an existing building (a former convent) and focuses on organic products for breakfast and reducing waste. The owners and staff will be happy to give you insider tips on alternative places (e.g. vintage shops, weekly markets or a repair café) where you can experience the metropolis in a sustainable way. #9 Strandhaus Boutique Resort & Spa, Spreewald, Germany (20 rooms) The Strandhaus Boutique Resort & Spa has an inviting location, surrounded by the arms of the Spree River. Boat rides start right outside the door. The hotel with only 20 rooms has a wellness area, a beach café, a restaurant (with authentic Spreewald cuisine), a library, and a beautiful garden with a green beach directly at the river. Sustainability: The hotel supports youth welfare, a kindergarten, and the local shooting club in Lübben. It also employs local staff. In general, the Strandhaus is a place where regionalism and the preservation of traditions are very important. Food comes from local farmers and some is growing in the hotel’s own garden. #10 Farmhouse Smiling Gecko, Kampong Chhnang Province, Cambodia (34 Rooms) At the Farmhouse Smiling Gecko you can stay in bungalows on stilts (with terraces and rain showers) or in one of the rooms in the Khmer House. There are a total of 34 rooms in 17 houses – the pool with sundeck or the restaurant serve as common meeting points. The unique feature: The Farmhouse is not just a luxury resort – it is a non-profit project! The Smiling Gecko Project supports the rural people of Cambodia to help themselves. People learn various trades in training centers, and 40 Cambodians are permanently working at the Farmhouse at an above-average salary. Sustainability: In addition to social sustainability, you can also experience the farm-to-table concept here. Meaning that the food comes directly from their own organic gardens and the surrounding agriculture. Hotel categorization by number of rooms The average hotel has about 150 rooms. As our analysis of available statistics shows, there are slightly fewer in Germany and Italy, and slightly more in Dubai. If you search the Internet to find out how many rooms a small, large, or medium-sized hotel has, you will find a wide variety of values. So here is our own definition: According to Green PearlsⓇ, you can divide hotels into the following categories: < 30 rooms: small hotel < 40 rooms: boutique hotel 40 to 100 rooms: midsize hotel 100 to 150 rooms: larger hotel >150 rooms: large hotel Finally, we would like to know your opinion – do you prefer to stay in large or small hotels?

5 accommodations for sustainable sleep in ancient masonry,"“Retirement at last! Now I finally have the time for vacations.” Today’s retirees are fit, well-educated, and eager to travel – and many of them have a sustainable outlook. Some have been for a long time (like the “old 68ers” or the founders of the eco-movement in the 1980s). Others have realized that we need to rethink in times of global warming, resource scarcity, and population explosion. “You don’t want bad karma at the end of your life,” my father (71) often says. People travel differently as they age Retirees don’t feel “old” in the traditional sense. But they certainly don’t want to take the kind of vacation they would have taken when they were 20. Hitchhiking, sharing rooms, eating bad and cheap food… when you’re young, you do a lot to stretch your limited financial resources. Young parents, on the other hand, put their children first in their travel plans. There should be children’s programs, playgrounds, water slides, fries and other children. But if you’re not in that stage of life, you can probably skip the mini-club, teen disco, and screaming kids on vacation. That doesn’t mean you don’t like kids! Maybe you even have grandchildren and love them more than anything? But does that mean you have to spend your vacation in a “kid-friendly hotel”? Of course not! Everyone has their own travel priorities, and we want to help you prepare so you can find the vacation that works for you – now. 7 Green Rules for Silver Nomads In April 2024, the British travel magazine Condé Nast Traveler created the “Golden Rules for Retirement Travel”. The 17 rules are based on interviews with frequent travelers, such as the blogger behind Traveling Black Widow, who has visited more than 100 countries. However, they did not consider sustainability specifically. We think though, that this is an important consideration for travelers of all ages. So we’ve come up with seven green rules. And if you’re worried about sacrificing amenities, let us reassure you: Fun, authentic experiences, and relaxation go hand in hand with sustainability! Slow Travel Time is the great luxury of retirement, and you should make the most of it! Instead of driving twelve hours in one day, try to make it three days and include some interesting stops. Also, take your time when you get to your destination, and do not cram too many activities into your itinerary. It’s better for you and the environment. Sustainable Journey Traveling to faraway countries has the biggest impact on the carbon footprint of your trip. However, we do not believe that people should stop flying. As tourism is an important source of income for many countries, and this is how wealth is distributed. Read more about this in our blog post “Are we still allowed to fly”. If you do travel long distances, make sure it is for an extended stay and avoid domestic flights or flights within Europe. Traveling by train is a good alternative. Pack and plan ahead for your special needs One of Condé Nast Traveller’s golden rules is: “BYOTP” (Bring Your Own Toilet Paper). We want to expand on this tip because we know from various Best Agers that their own “quirks” simply become more important over time. Some people bring their own toilet paper, others their reading lamp, extra towel hooks for the bathroom, a travel kettle, an iron, a yoga mat, clothes hangers… If you’re the kind of person who’s annoyed every day on vacation when you don’t have certain things, it’s best to bring them yourself – or ask your accommodation if they can provide them! Pack light Although we recommend that you bring important “extras” with you, you should still try to pack light in general. Light weight and volume are not only better for the environment, but also more comfortable when boarding trains, etc. Retired travel professionals have created a “travel wardrobe” over the years with a capsule wardrobe that can be easily combined. Book appropriate and sustainable accommodations Sustainably managed accommodations focus on green energy, local organic food, fair treatment of employees, waste reduction, and community involvement. In this way, you can make a positive impact while you travel. Learn a few words of the local language “Hello”, “Thank you”, and “Please” – even the simplest phrases are received positively and make you more popular as a guest. Do not procrastinate Your experience of life has surely shown you that nothing is certain. If you were healthy yesterday, you could be sick tomorrow. Or there could be a pandemic, war, or natural disaster – and suddenly travel is no longer possible. So take advantage of the opportunity to travel when it presents itself. Whether you are retired or nearing it! Visa requirements and international health insurance for retirees Sustainable Adults-Only Hotels in Europe Back to the hotels without kids clubs and waterslides. Adults-only hotels have become a global trend. Here, the emphasis is on tranquility, and you will find creative, multi-course delicacies on your dinner plate. The focus is on peace and relaxation. Sounds perfect for you? Then let us introduce you to some sustainable adults-only hotels in Italy, Spain and Germany: #1 LA VIMEA, Italy, South Tyrol – Vegan hotel with daily yoga Located in Naturns, LA VIMEA, with its natural swimming pond, barrel sauna, and e-bike rental, is a wonderful place to relax. The adults-only hotel offers a natural atmosphere and daily yoga. The hotel also offers Ayurvedic medicine and treatments. Another special feature is the cuisine, which is exclusively vegan. #2 My Arbor, Italy, South Tyrol – Exceptional wellness hotel on stilts My Arbor near Brixen stands on stilts directly in the forest and offers a wonderful view of the Plose. The area is known for its moderate hills, which offer excellent hiking opportunities for all ages and fitness levels. There is a large spa area with pools, saunas and massage rooms. My Arbor also offers “me-time“. Meaning, the adults-only hotel has a concept of making everything just the way you want it and tailoring the hotel to your needs. For example, you can have breakfast until 2 p.m! #3 Lifestylehotel SAND, Germany, Schleswig-Holstein – A natural and relaxing vacation Light, sandy colors, natural materials, COCO-MAT beds and a special attention to detail – these are the hallmarks of the adults-only Lifestylehotel SAND. Located in Timmendorfer Strand, directly on the beach of the Baltic Sea, the hotel has a charm all year round. A highlight of the hotel is the roof terrace with sauna and deck chairs – a wonderful place to relax. #4 Casa León Royal Retreat, Spain, Gran Canaria – Enjoy and recharge your batteries On a vacation island as popular as Gran Canaria, you should pay special attention to finding the right sustainable hotel (without a youth disco). The small boutique hotel Casa León Royal Retreat is located in the interior of the island, far away from the beach resorts of Maspalomas. Lovingly run by the German-speaking owner family, the hotel with pool and gardens has only 27 rooms. Sports activities include tennis, aquagym, yoga, hiking and regular (free) shuttles to nearby golf courses or the beach. #5 Naturresort Gerbehof, Germany, Lake Constance – Adults Only outside school holidays There are two different times at Gerbehof Nature Resort. A family time, where children are welcome and offered an appropriate program, and a time reserved for adults, where peace and quiet are the order of the day. The nature resort near Lake Constance is surrounded by the famous apple trees. A feast for the eyes, especially when they are in bloom. If you are a follower of the Philippi Method (bioenergetic meditations and treatments according to Viktor Philippi), you will be happy to know that it is a main focus of the hotel. #6 STURM, Germany, Rhön – Relaxation in nature The Rhön, a low mountain range in Germany, is partly a UNESCO Biosphere Reserve and offers a beautiful landscape of forests, basalt peaks, and moors. The STURM is located in Mellrichstadt at the foot of the Rhön. Although not a designated Adults Only hotel, the new garden view rooms overlooking the hotel’s natural swimming pond can be booked by adults only. The rooms, made of natural materials, were designed by German architect Matthias Loebermann, who won the “best architects award” for this project in 2023. Green PearlsⓇ Accommodation for Golden Agers outside Europe There are also sustainable Green PearlsⓇ partners outside of Europe we can recommend to travelers in the 60+ age group. #1 La Casona, Peru, Cusco – Discover the treasures of the Incas The Andean region of Peru is one of the most fascinating areas on the planet. As we report in our Green Travel Guide to the Andes, due to the altitude of over 3000 meters, you should allow a few days for acclimatization before starting your sightseeing program with Machu Picchu and other sites from the Inca era. An excellent starting point is the ancient Inca capital of Cusco. The luxurious boutique hotel Inkaterra La Casona is located in a former Spanish colonial mansion. It stands on a former training ground for the Inca army. The rooms feature restored original frescoes and Inkaterra provides expert local guides. #2 Pavilions Himalayas – The Farm, Nepal – Safari Tours and Authentic Nepal Another place where Silver Nomads should feel right at home is the boutique resort Pavilions Himalayas – The Farm. It consists of 15 Nepalese-style villas and the owners originally established it to introduce local farmers to organic farming. Surrounded by breathtaking scenery with views of the Himalayas, you will find time for guided yoga and meditation classes, temple excursions, and wildlife safaris. Accommodations such as Inkaterra La Casona and Pavilions Himalayas offer luxurious amenities for sustainable (long-distance) retirement travel while also committing to sustainability. They strive to preserve both cultural heritage and nature for their grandchildren and great-grandchildren through various projects (see Inkaterra Acociatión).

Peru: From the rain forest to the cloud forest and Machu Picchu,"A relaxing vacation means “lying on a deck chair and doing nothing,” right? Wrong. Studies show actively pursuing a hobby can help you feel more relaxed, positive, and actually less prone to illness as you age. Statista’s latest data, published in February 2024, shows the most popular hobbies to pursue during your “hobbydays” (instead of “Holidays”). It looked at the most popular hobbies in 13 countries around the world, and we will tell you more about them. Why hobbies boost happiness Having a hobby is linked to long-term happiness in old age. That’s the result of a global study conducted in 2023. The London-based UCL Institute of Epidemiology & Health Care surveyed 90,000 people in 16 countries (Europe, USA, Japan, China) and found that: People who have a hobby experience a decrease in depressive symptoms and an increase in life satisfaction and happiness. According to neuroscientist Ciara McCabe, a professor at the University of Reading, many hobbies also improve our health and prevent disease. Playing a musical instrument improves memory, while reading as well as playing board games helps prevent dementia in later life. So, it’s not just the well-known “health hobbies” like fitness, walking or yoga that promote good health, but also crafts and games. A hobby traveler’s hotel Science suggests that the left hemisphere of the brain processes logical and rational thinking, while the right hemisphere processes emotional and creative thinking. “The vast majority of pursuits and hobbies are about getting the left brain to shut up.” British PR guru Matthew Freud says. The producer has recently ventured into the hotel business, opening an experimental luxury hotel for hobby travelers. At The Bull in Burford, UK, guests are encouraged to take up hobbies. There’s a book club, photography workshops, chess, yoga classes, gardening… not participating is like going to a restaurant and not eating. But the focus of the hotel is on luxury and community, not sustainability. Moreover, if you study lists of the most popular hobbies in different countries, not all of them are environmentally friendly (e.g., motorcycling or recreational flying). What are the most popular hobbies around the world? We looked at lists from different countries (13 in total) to determine the most popular hobbies. Interesting: In 5 countries (including Switzerland and India), “traveling” is the number one hobby. Also among the top hobbies are: However, there are several surveys with different results regarding hobbies. For example, according to Statista, the “most common leisure activity” of Germans is gardening. Not mentioned anywhere is stamp collecting, which I used to do as a kid (it’s incredible how you can feel so old at the age of 41 🙂 ). Sustainable hobbies for your Hobbydays What hobbies do you have? Or what hobbies would you like to have? If you want to spend some Hobbydays (we had to bring in that gurky pun again). We have some nice ideas for you. Just trying a hobby once on holiday can “kickstart our reward system and subsequently our motivation to do the hobby again,” says Professor Ciara McCabe, an Associate Professor of Neuroscience in the Department of Psychology at the University of Reading. Sustainability depends on how many resources your hobby uses and how you practice it. Reading is more sustainable if you buy used books, and exercise is more sustainable if it is done without electronics or sports facility (e.g. trail running instead of track running). A sustainable cooking class can teach you how to cook without waste, and a craft class can bring items back to life by upcycling them instead of buying new (and usually less sustainable) materials just for a craft idea. Below you will find a selection of hobbies we covered on the Green Travel Blog, along with the corresponding “Hobbyday” accommodation. In addition, you will find out about sustainability in each article – just click on the picture! Did we forget to mention a hobby? Probably! Tell us in the comments about your hobbies and how the perfect Hobbydays would look for you. Save the article on Pinterest so you can find it again and again!"
Peru: From the rain forest to the cloud forest and Machu Picchu,"This is the second part of our Peru Travel Guide. In the first part, we provided important information on how to prepare for a sustainable trip to Peru and described the sights in the Andes and in the south (i.e. Machu Picchu to Lake Titicaca). In addition to the fascinating mountains, in Peru you have the opportunity to experience a real jungle adventure in the Amazon rainforest. You can expect almost daily afternoon rains, very high humidity, high temperatures and extremely dense vegetation. You will find more species of plants and animals here than anywhere else on earth. Sustainable hotels in Peru: Inkaterra at the forefront of green tourism‘ To experience Peru sustainably, you should pay special attention to your choice of accommodation. Instead of staying in a hotel blog, which has a huge impact on the environment, produces mountains of packaging waste, and may exploit workers, look for smaller, owner-managed accommodations or homestays. For something more luxurious (even in the jungle), we recommend Inkaterra Hotels. They run seven properties, four of which are Green PearlsⓇ partners. Inkaterra’s history The founder of Inkaterra, José Koechlin von Stein, is a member of the Koechlin family. They came to Peru from Alsace in 1852 and have been rooted here for generations. In 1975, José purchased the first piece of land on which he built the Inkaterra Reserva Amazónica. In addition, he founded the non-profit Inkaterra Asociación to protect the environment and species, preserving Peru’s cultural treasures and raw materials, and supporting the local population. “Sustainable travel is (…) he most effective way to raise awareness on our planet’s natural resources. Only when travelling we get to know local cultures and natural environments. We learn about their uniqueness as well as their fragility, and then we are engaged to their preservation for future generations to come..” – José Koechlin von Stein in an Interview with Sustainable Leaders Inkaterra Asociación’s successful projects When you choose to stay with Inkaterra Authentic Nature Travel, you are also indirectly supporting their projects. These include: Sustainable vacation in the Amazon At all Inkaterra hotels, highly trained local guides will accompany you and show you the natural beauty and cultural treasures of the country. Tip: If bird watching is your thing, take a birding tour with Hiroshi Sánchez at Inkaterra Hacienda Urubamba. He has a passion for birds, and you can learn a lot from him! The jungle is nature and life – unlike the desert, where you see vast lands, there is life in abundance! It’s loud, it’s growing, it’s moving, it’s green, it’s sprouting. A canopy walk takes you right under the canopy where monkeys leap, birds fly, and fascinating insects sit on the leaves all around you. The small “tropical house” you may know from the zoo is nothing compared to the real jungle with its colors and sounds. All the more frightening that rainforests are disappearing from our planet. A trip to the rainforest (without lighting fires, hunting animals, or damaging nature in any other way) will surely inspire you to do more for the green lungs of our planet. For example, it is important to avoid the use of tropical wood (watch out for barbecue charcoal), and the use of aluminum, etc. is also related to the protection of the rainforest. Read more about this in this Insight. Preparing for your Rainforest Tour The Tambopata National Reserve – adjacent to Inkaterra’s Reserva Amazonica and the Amazon Field Station of Inkaterra – recommends the following preparation: Packing List for the Jungle Sustainable journey to the rainforest of Peru The Amazon region around the Amazon River is an entirely different side of the country. Many people fly into the jungle in small planes. A flight from Cusco takes about 2 hours 40 minutes and doesn’t cost much (about 100 to 300 Euros). However, it is more sustainable to take the bus. It takes much longer (about 10 hours), but it is much cheaper (about 20 to 50 Euros), more environmentally friendly, and you get a special experience of the country. It is also possible to follow the slow travel principle and discover a lot on the trip itself by splitting the route. Between Cusco and Iquitos, for example, you could spend a day in the Reserva Nacional Pacaya Samiria. The largest nature reserve in Peru, it is home to fascinating flora and fauna. Slow travel also has the advantage of allowing you to get used to the new climate. 🙂 Green sights – the Amazon rainforest in Peru The jungle is the natural habitat for approximately two-thirds of all animals and plants on our planet. In fact, there are probably millions of species yet to be discovered! It is home to colorful macaws and many species of monkeys, such as howler and squirrel monkeys. What you may not realize is that in many places, the jungle floor is inaccessible to humans. It is so densely overgrown that sunlight cannot reach the ground, leaving you in total darkness. Only enter the jungle with a knowledgeable jungle guide. Sustainable accommodation: Inkaterra Reserva Amazónica At Inkaterra Reserva Amazónica in the Tambopata region, you will find experienced English-speaking guides. This is where Inkaterra began, and you will stay in naturally designed guest rooms and suites with hammocks and mosquito nets. Experience the jungle with expert guides on ropes courses, boat trips, and trails. There are also regular nature lectures. Tip: If you like, you can even spend the night in a treehouse! Read more in our article about treehouse hotels. Conclusion – Peru: The trip of a lifetime Peru is an extraodinary place. A country with over 2,000 kilometers of coastline, desert, snow-capped 6,000-meter mountains, and jungle. Here you will meet incredibly friendly people and see animals such as penguins, sea lions, condors, macaw parrots, monkeys, and guanacos (the wild alpacas) in the wild. Peru is a colorful mix of Inca history, indigenous culture, colonial heritage, and modern nation-state. You will find luxury and poverty, but most of all hospitality, natural beauty, and closeness to nature. A trip to Peru will make you marvel at the treasures of our planet – and perhaps motivate you to preserve them for the future. Save this article for your Peru trip!"
Peru: From the rain forest to the cloud forest and Machu Picchu,"Peru is undoubtedly one of the most fascinating countries in South America. Wherever you go, you will discover cultural and natural treasures that cannot be found anywhere else in the world. To preserve them, we ask ourselves how a trip like this can be made sustainable. After all, we want to avoid disturbing sites like the ancient Inca city of Machu Picchu. The ruins have already been forced to close in 2023 due to erosion caused by too many visitors. Here you will find important tips and addresses for an environmentally friendly and respectful stay and, of course, many recommendations for travel regions, sights and activities. The first part covers The second part deals with 11 tips to travel sustainably in Peru Mobility Planning your Trip In Peru Acclimatization in Peru – Reasons, tips and prevention Before we get to the country’s attractions, there is another important thing to consider: acclimatization. Depending on where you come from (e.g. Europe, North America or the Middle East), Peru’s climate will be very different from the one you are used to. It can take some time to adjust, and you should take this into account when preparing for your trip (and don’t take it lightly!). Mountain acclimatization in Peru The Andes are the longest and highest mountain range in South America and include numerous six-thousand-meter peaks. (The highest mountain in Peru is Nevado Huascarán at 6,768 meters). Above 2,400 meters, the air pressure is 25% lower than at sea level. Your body will need to adjust. If you ascend to high altitudes too quickly, you run the risk of altitude sickness (headache, dizziness, nausea, etc.). If you are traveling to Peru, you may want to start at lower altitudes to give your body a few days to adjust to the air. First Machu Picchu, then Cusco Machu Picchu is located at 2,400 meters and is the lowest point in the Cusco region. This makes Machu Picchu the perfect starting point for exploring the Inca cities. Here you will find the Inkaterra Machu Picchu Pueblo Hotel, which we will introduce later. Cusco itself is located at an altitude of 3,300 meters, the air pressure here is about 33% lower than at sea level, but if you have gotten a little used to the high altitude air beforehand, you should have no problems here. Precautions against altitude sickness The cuisine of Peru To discover Peru sustainably, be sure to try the local food! You can buy fresh produce cheaply at the markets, as well as local street food and in great little restaurants. If you want to impress the Andean farmers, you can practice peeling potatoes at home. Many different types of potatoes are eaten here, and a good bride who is new to her in-laws must prove that she can peel even the “difficult” potatoes. 🙂 There are also a few specialties that may not be for everyone, such as ceviche (raw fish) or cuy (guinea pig), as well as many deliciously spiced bean and rice dishes or cornmeal desserts that are suitable for vegetarian travelers. Discover the sights of the Cusco region in a sustainable way As mentioned in the beginning, Peru has a wealth of sights and contrasts that you wouldn’t find in any other country! A desert by the sea, the famous Rainbow Mountains, cultural treasures of the Incas – there is so much to see that we can only highlight some of the main attractions. Of course, we have chosen them (randomly, as always ;-)) in the vicinity of our Green PearlsⓇ partners. Machu Picchu Who would travel to Peru without seeing the UNESCO World Heritage Site with their own eyes? Just climbing up to the ruins of the former Inca city amidst the mountains is so magical and fantastic that it’s thoroughly different from, say, visiting the pyramids in Cairo. You can reach Machu Picchu either by bus or on foot with a guide on the Inca Trail. Machu Picchu in high or low season? According to the Machu Picchu Center, the busiest months are June, July and August. This is mainly because many people go on vacation during this time, and it is also the dry season. This means a good chance of getting fog-free photos – but also plenty of other tourists. It is more sustainable to travel in the off-season. This would be By taking advantage of the rainy season, you help spread out the crowds over the year, giving nature more time to regenerate. Water conservation, waste management, etc. can simply be better managed if tourism is spread out rather than rushed over a few months. In addition, November to April is known as “orchid season” in Peru and is the best time to see the unique orchid collection at Inkaterra Machu Picchu Pueblo Hotel in full bloom. Sustainable accommodation: Inkaterra Machu Picchu Pueblo Hotel The hotel is located near the train station (eco-friendly travel) and was built as a small village with local materials in the style of Andean villages. Surrounding the rooms is a large estate with several charming trails allowing you to observe orchids (372 species of native orchids), birds (214 species) and butterflies (111 species). Cusco – the former capital of the Incas Cusco was the former capital of the Incas and considered itself the center of the world. You should visit the city if you want to delve deeper into the history of the Incas. Cusco also offers many colorful markets and tourist amenities such as Wi-Fi hotspots, ATMs, a tourist information office and good bus service. Sustainable accommodation in Cusco: Inkaterra La Casona In Cusco, Inkaterra operates a luxurious hideaway in a restored 16th century mansion. Inkaterra La Casona consists of just 11 suites in the heart of the vibrant city. In addition to antique furniture, you will find restored frescoes on the walls, some of which are 500 years old. The boutique hotel is an excellent base for exploring the Cusco region, as most tours start here. Recommended reading for the Cusco area Inkaterra has recommended a few books in English to read before or during your trip: Accommodation in the Sacred Valley: Inkaterra Hacienda Urubamba Inkaterra Hacienda Urubamba is also located in the Cusco region. This hotel is located in the “Sacred Valley” between shimmering reddish mountains. The “holiness” probably comes from the fact that Urubamba is the most fertile valley in all of Peru and is therefore considered particularly “blessed”. It is ideal for family vacations and offers many opportunities for a gentle nature vacation. Inkaterra also allows you to meet and support local artisans and farmers. Ruins of Ollantaytambo and the Salt Terraces of Maras From Cusco, you can take day trips to many other Inca cities. After Machu Picchu, the most famous are the ruins of Ollantaytambo and the salt terraces of Maras. Rainbow Mountains You should also visit the Rainbow Mountains if you are in the Cusco area – regular buses leave from Cusco itself. Please note – many leave at 3am, and you will need good shoes and a good level of fitness. The Rainbow Mountains, at an altitude of about 4,000 meters, are striking for their magnificent colors. Combined with the mountain panorama they offer a fantastic nature experience and the trip is definitely worthwhile – but it is no longer an insider tip and with about 600 visitors per day it already falls into the category of mass tourism. Southwestern Peru Sights The south and southwest of Peru are for the most part desert. The Nazca Lines, visible from the sky, are famous and remain a mystery. However, visiting them from the ground is not as spectacular (as you cannot see them) and we do not recommend booking a flight over them for sustainability reasons. Many documentary filmmakers have done this for us and explained in their movies what the lines are all about! There are also many other great sights that you reach much more sustainably 😉 Paracas National Reserve – wildlife watching The Paracas Peninsula and the Islas Ballestas are an absolute highlight for many Peru travelers. They are part of a nature reserve and offer a unique natural environment with a mixture of desert and sea. On a boat tour, you can see seals, penguins, dolphins and seabirds. The reserve is located in the southwest of Peru, about 460 kilometers from Cusco. Colca Canyon – Valley of the Condors In the Colca Canyon you can see condors flying overhead. It is one of the largest birds of prey in the world. Its wingspan can be up to 3 meters, which is quite impressive! It belongs to the family of vultures, more specifically the New World vultures. For those looking for an exciting place to hike, the Colca Canyon is definitely an experience! And if you usually have the problem that you can’t see birds in the treetops – it’s not difficult here! (Because of their size, you can’t miss them – caption) 🙂 Lake Titicaca – Souvenirs from Uros Not only does Lake Titicaca have a super cool name, but it is also beautiful. The lake sits on a plateau at nearly 4,000 meters and borders Bolivia on the other side of the water. At Lake Titicaca, you can not only go boating and swimming (if you don’t mind the cold) but also learn about the culture of the Urus. They still live on floating islands, they build themselves out of totora reeds. Such an island lasts about 50 years and is continuously maintained by the Urus. In the past, the tribe lived mainly from fishing, but nowadays, tourism is an important source of income. Meaning you are now directly addressed. 🙂 You can buy all kinds of colorful things from them, such as handmade windchimes, hats, bowls, rugs, dolls, boats, necklaces, and so on. The ideal place to stock up on souvenirs for the long haul. Sustainability in Peru – Connecting with Pachamama (Mother Earth) Most of the 55 or so indigenous ethnic groups live in the Amazon region. Only four groups belong to the so-called Andean peoples. They have a special connection to the goddess Pachamama (Mother Earth) and everything that comes from her. Therefore, they focus their lives on creating a balance between different forces, practicing work, prayers, and rituals in harmony and gratitude with Mother Earth. Tip: If you travel to Peru in August, you can participate in a “Pay the Earth” ceremony that takes place throughout the country during that month. You should make sure that you don’t fall into a “tourist trap”, but support the local population as directly as possible! Even if we have no religious or spiritual connection to Pachamama, we should still try to appreciate and protect nature when we travel. This is true not only when traveling to and in Peru, but all over the world. Save this article for your planning!"
The 5 most beautiful eco-luxury hotels in the Alps,"Clean beaches and seas, unspoiled nature in the mountains – that’s what tourists want. And hotels want to deliver. The problem is that the hotel industry itself is a major source of plastic waste. Single-use plastics in the form of typical hotel slippers, small packages in the bathroom and at the buffet, along with straws and cups, add up to mountains of plastic in conventional hotels. We took a look at sustainable Green PearlsⓇ hotels, what alternatives are available and how to avoid single-use plastics in general. The problem with disposables in hotels When you stay at a hotel, you get everything you need: your luggage is taken care of, a refreshing drink is waiting for you in your room, a variety of toiletries are available in the bathroom, towels and slippers are provided… and while you are lying by the pool or sitting in the restaurant, your room is cleaned, the bed is made and all opened tubes and packages are replaced with new ones. Sound great? For sustainability-minded travelers like you, probably not. Because: All of this (among other things) creates a lot of waste. Hotels and vacation rentals definitely have a single-use problem, and it has to do with the following:: Expensive hotels produce less waste than cheap ones According to the DEHOGA environmental brochure, 0 to 2-star hotels produce 9.1 liters of waste per guest per day, 4-star hotels 3.4 liters (5-star hotels produce slightly more at 3.7 liters). According to the German Hotel and Restaurant Association (DEHOGA), this is mainly due to disposable packaging in the lower star categories. In the upscale hotel industry, less disposable packaging is used simply for style’s sake – e.g. cloth napkins instead of paper napkins, ceramic or stainless steel milk jugs instead of plastic condensed milk containers, etc. But simply choosing a higher star rating is not enough to eliminate waste and single-use packaging. Especially since not everyone can or wants to. Above all, it takes hoteliers who really care and are committed to reducing waste in their properties. Zero waste or at least “less waste” is a central concern for Green Pearls® accommodations. Each accommodation has its own approach to waste reduction, which you can read about on the Green Pearls® pages and on their individual websites. As mentioned above, many of them are Zero Waste representatives, striving for a low environmental footprint and a circular economy in all areas. We believe that Green PearlsⓇ hotels are among the lowest waste producers in the industry. “In terms of waste and plastic reduction, sustainably certified hotels are generally more advanced than non-certified hotels.” – WWF WWF study on single-use and reusable products in the hospitality industry In 2019 and 2024, WWF Germany investigated the issue of single-use plastics in the hotel industry. For the 2019 study, WWF surveyed hotels and hotel guests in Italy, France, Greece and Spain. In 2024, the data was supplemented by expert interviews and a literature review. It found that the majority of guests use significantly more reusable packaging at home than on vacation. Hoteliers are determined to act, but face many obstacles: For every 50 million disposables, only half a million reusables are sold “In 2022, the share of reusable packaging (by number of items) in the hotel industry was only 1.2 percent. (600,000 items compared to 50.6 million disposable items) and consisted almost entirely of beverage containers.” – Untersuchung der Gesellschaft für Verpackungsmarktforschung mbH (GVM) für den WWF All too often, “habit” is to blame for not using reusable products. By the way, the WWF believes that reusable products make much more sense than disposable products made from “eco-materials”. In other words, a refillable plastic bottle is better than a disposable bamboo cup. Washable cloth napkins are better than disposable napkins made from recycled cellulose. This is how sustainable hotels avoid disposable packaging Amenities upon request Many sustainable hotels and resorts have started to remove amenities such as toothbrushes, razors, sewing kits, etc. from the rooms and store them at the front desk. That way, you still get them, but only if you really need and ask for them. “By providing standard amenities only upon request, we avoid unnecessary use,” says Farmhouse Smiling Gecko in Cambodia. The resort also offers many homemade products from the resort’s own workshops, which Smiling Gecko uses to support the local community. When it comes to the amenities that are still offered on request, sustainable accommodation also ensures that they are produced sustainably and fairly. This is what the Naturresort Gerbehof in Friedrichshafen on Lake Constance reports. Honesty bar with reusable glasses instead of a minibar The minibar is another element that must be provided to meet hotel standards. In addition to energy consumption, drinks and snacks in disposable packaging also have a negative impact on the environment. Gut Guntrams near Vienna therefore installed a “central minibar” in the form of a Honesty Bar and left the individual minibars in the rooms empty. The Honesty Bar offers homemade sweet and savory treats in reusable glass jars. Homemade welcome cookies A small welcome gift for guests is a nice touch. But as Zero Waste advocate Béá Johnson says, promotional gifts and giveaways are often a source of waste. Not so at the Hotel Bella Vista Zermatt in Switzerland. There, homemade cookies on a plate greet guests in the mountains near the Matterhorn. A water bottle for the duration of your stay Many hotels provide their guests with a refillable water bottle. At the OCÉANO Health Spa Hotel on Tenerife, the “OCÉANO Glass Bottle” is available and there are water dispensers throughout the hotel where you can refill the bottle with fresh, filtered water. This fits in with the wide range of sports and wellness activities on offer and also saves a lot of bottles and miles of transportation 🙂 Source of waste: breakfast buffet? Zero waste is also an option! One of the biggest contributors to packaging and food waste in the hotel industry is the breakfast buffet. All Green Pearls® hotels have optimized this aspect. “There are no packaged products at our breakfast buffet,” reports the APIPURA hotel rinner on the ritten in South Tyrol. Instead, the child-friendly hotel offers organic products in small jars – one of the highlights are the various types of organic honey from the hotel’s own beekeeping. Zero waste measures at the breakfast buffet: Elimination of disposable hygiene products Disposable bathroom hygiene products are the second major area where mountains of plastic waste accumulate in conventional hotels. This refers to the small packages of shampoo, shower gel, soap, body lotion, shower cap, toothbrush, razor and so on. Sustainable hotels show that these products can be provided to guests in a stylish and hygienic way and do not have to be the norm. Solid Soap and Shampoo At the Klosterhof Alpine Hideaway & Spa in Berchtesgadener Land, Bavaria, the bathroom features soap and shampoo bars, as well as refillable shower gel dispensers as an alternative to traditional bottles. You can do the same at home, by the way! Dispenser Speaking of dispensers: Another option you might want to consider for the home are refillable, larger, and often more attractive dispensers for soap, shampoo, conditioner, shower gel, and the like. According to soap manufacturer MarcelsGreenSoap, a refill bag saves 85% of plastic packaging! Almost all Green Pearls® accommodations now use dispensers – with natural ingredients. “Our shampoos and shower gels (in the dispensers) are from Tiroler Kräuterhof, so they are 100% natural and regional,” reports Summit Lodges Pfunds. Biohotel Grafenast in Tyrol even offers dispensers with arnica muscle gel for relaxation after long hikes around the Pillberg 😉 Natural cosmetics free of chemicals and microplastics For our Green PearlsⓇ partners, the use of environmentally friendly cosmetic products is very important. At Pavilions Himalayas – The Farm in Nepal, you can buy bamboo toothbrushes with hemp bristles and plastic-free toothpaste tabs made according to Ayurvedic principles, as are the other personal care products. Avoiding chemicals and microplastics is particularly important to them to protect the water quality of their organic farm.. The Green Spirit hotels in Paris (Hotel Malar, Hotel Amelie and Hotel Le Pavillon, all in the central 7th arrondissement within walking distance of the Eiffel Tower) use soaps, shampoos and shower gels from Austrian natural cosmetics company Pure Green. The luxurious Klosterbräu wellness hotel in Seefeld, Tyrol, spoils its guests with premium products from Augustinus Bader – some of which have been developed exclusively for the hotel. The Lifestylehotel SAND in Timmendorfer Strand on the Baltic Sea has embraced ‘Björk&Berries‘. Nordic, sustainable, refillable and stylish,” they say. Food from their own harvest In the hotel industry, buying food in bulk is one way to reduce unnecessary packaging. Where possible, regionally. “We work almost exclusively with local suppliers to avoid long transport routes and support the regional economy,” says My Arbor near Brixen in South Tyrol. However, food packaging is avoided in particular through direct in-house production. “From cakes to chocolates to syrups, we make everything ourselves,” explains the adults-only wellness hotel. “All our fresh fruit and vegetables come from our own farm in Albisano on Lake Garda. The owner, Mr Huber, personally takes care of the harvest and brings the produce directly to the hotel (without packaging waste) so that our guests can enjoy the freshest ingredients.” – My Arbor Dishes and glasses Disposable plastic cups at hotels? They do exist! Some hoteliers find them more convenient and less risky than glass or porcelain, especially for the lawn or pool. Unfortunately, they create a huge amount of waste. Sustainable hotels are careful to use only high-quality, plastic-free materials. The energy-independent aparthotel OLM Nature Escape in Sand in Taufers, South Tyrol, uses only glass, porcelain, ceramic, clay and enamel for food and drink. Tablecloths and napkins Just as glass and porcelain are more stylish than plastic tableware, cloth napkins are more sophisticated than paper napkins. You can find them, for example, at the Relais del Maro in Liguria. The Albergo Diffuso in the picturesque village of Borgomaro takes care to avoid waste in all areas. Consequently, linen tablecloths are washed rather than thrown away. Towel change upon request only Since laundry does not produce waste, but does use detergent, water and energy, daily hotel laundry is another factor that you, as a guest, can help with. Many guests notice that even towels that have been hung up are all replaced the next day. This calls for well-trained staff who, like at the Lifestyle Resort Zum Kurfürsten on the Mosel, change towels only when requested. Even in the large wellness area with sauna and several pools, guests are asked to use sauna towels sparingly and sometimes several times. Forgoing daily room cleaning and turn-down service Similarly, as a guest, you can support a hotel’s sustainability efforts by choosing not to have your room cleaned daily. In most cases, you have to explicitly decline. For example, the sustainable Hotel Luise in Erlangen, Germany, tried to switch to opt-in (i.e., you get daily room cleaning only if you want it), but that would have meant being stripped of all their hotel stars by the Hotel Stars Union! However, at the ADLER Lodge RITTEN in South Tyrol (a luxurious all-inclusive resort close to nature), the turndown service has become an opt-in offer. This means that rooms are only prepared in the evening if you, the guest, specifically request it. No slippers The slippers provided in a hotel’s spa area are disposable products that generate huge amounts of waste. According to the German magazine Focus, the Steigenberger Hotels alone (a total of 60 hotels and resorts) would order 180,000 pairs of slippers for their guests each year. One can only imagine the mountain of slipper waste in the entire industry! The HUBERTUS Mountain Refugio Allgäu has therefore removed the slippers from the rooms and will only provide them upon request. Instead, guests are asked to bring their own. The romantic Hotel Das Rübezahl in Füssen, Germany, takes a similar approach to the slipper issue: guests are only provided with hotel slippers for the spa upon request, and the slippers are made of linen and cork, making them compostable. Backpack and shopping bag provided In many vacation destinations, plastic bags are still the norm. Even though a lot of plastic waste could be avoided! That is why CERVO Mountain Resort Zermatt in Switzerland provides guests with both a backpack for hiking and reusable bags for shopping. Digital Guest Magazine Digitization also reduces waste. Guests receive a digital reservation confirmation, there is a digital guest magazine and digital services. At the Eco-Hotel Okelmann’s, for example, you can download Komoot maps created by Senior Okelmann to your phone so you can start cycling right away. The Hotel Klosterbräu in Seefeld, Tyrol, has a guest channel on the hotel TV where you can find out about all the events and offers at the hotel. Offering waste separation for guests As mentioned at the beginning, many people use more disposable items on vacation than at home. Recycling is also often not as successful on vacation. However, this is not always the guests’ fault… You may have experienced the situation where there is only one disposable waste bin in the hotel room and you don’t even have the opportunity to separate your own waste. Some hotels may also think that their international guests don’t know how to it. Not so at Keemala on the island of Phuket in Thailand. “We have clearly marked recycling and waste stations throughout the resort, making it easy for guests to dispose of their waste properly,” they wrote to us. Unlike many internationally managed hotels on the island of Phuket, Keemala is owned by a local family who are very conscious of their impact on the environment. The 5-star ADLER Lodge RITTEN is another example of how in-room waste separation can be done in style. Toilet paper made out of Tetra Pak According to Statista, global per capita consumption of toilet paper reach almost 14 kilograms per person in 2023. However, in Germany, the figure is much higher, at 30.6 kilograms per person. A lot of trees have to be cut down to produce all this fresh fiber. The SCHWARZWALD PANORAMA in Bad Herrenalb has switched to toilet paper made from recycled beverage cartons. This reflects the concept of recycling that the wellness and selfness hotel also applies to its room furnishings. Wooden coffee pods eliminate single-use plastics Coffee capsule machines are definitely not the most sustainable way to make coffee. However, they are a great solution for allowing guests in a hotel suite to make their own coffee. The Birkenhof***** Spa and Genuss Resort uses Rezemo wooden coffee capsules. They contain coffee from sustainable sources. The other amenities of the 5-star wellness hotel are packaged in plastic-free cardboard as well. Zero-Waste Goodbye Gift When you leave, hotels often give you a small parting gift – and that too is a source of packaging waste. Of course, sustainable hotels have also thought about how to give you, the guest, a gift that is both beautiful and environmentally friendly. At the Naturhotel Outside in the Hohe Tauern National Park in East Tyrol, Austria, guests receive a jar of homemade jam in a reusable glass jar. The Hotel Weihrerhof in South Tyrol, on the Italian side of the Alps, offers soaps from its own organic cosmetics line, BergSea, which uses water from the Wolfsgruben Lake, located directly in front of the hotel. “We want our guests to take the soaps home with them and continue to dream of the Weihrerhof,” says the host family. As you can see, Green PearlsⓇ hotels have put a lot of thought into how they can eliminate single-use items, waste and plastic, which means you may use no more single-use items on your vacation than you would at home – in fact, you may use fewer items than at home!"
Vacation by bike: Ideas for the world bicycle day,"From the cold cut to the cover – at sustainable hotels you can discover great, eco-friendly and fair hotel products that might also be an inspiration for you back home. Do products make an accommodation sustainable? As we see time and again at Green PearlsⓇ accommodations, the paths to greater sustainability are many and varied. It always depends on local conditions and opportunities – as well as the individual priorities of hoteliers. Particularly critical to sustainability in the hotel industry are Things like “honey from your own beehive” are not that important in the overall ecological balance. However, the many small contributions add up, and for the guest, the attention to detail often makes all the difference. 18 environmental and resource friendly products #1 Workwear Many sustainable hotels pay attention to sustainability when it comes to their employees’ workwear. Here are some key points that will make not only your workwear, but also all your everyday clothing, better: 👉Read more on our blog about sustainable hotel workwear. #2 Bathrobe The bathrobe is one of the luxuries a hotel offers. As with any item of clothing, fashions change regularly. In recent years, for example, robes have become more selfie-friendly or come with smartphone-sized pockets. Colorful hooded robes made with GOTS-certified organic cotton are all the rage. But some sustainable hotels have decided not to phase out the classic white robe, because it’s more sustainable to use well-maintained items for as long as possible. 👉Here are the bathrobe trends for 2024/2025. #3 Beds and bedding Hästens beds are not only the most expensive beds in the world, they are also very popular with many of our sustainable hotel partners (e.g. CERVO Mountain Resort Zermatt). These boxsprings are handmade in Sweden and filled with horsehair. Other partners rely on COCO MAT’s vegan beds (e.g. the Lifestylehotel SAND at the Baltic Sea). 👉Learn more about sleeping comfort at eco-hotels and vacation rentals #4 Bread Have you ever enjoyed a bread sommelier’s selection of breads? In our blog, we talked with bread sommelier Benjamin Profanter from the Naturbackstube in Brixen. He supplies the wellness hotel My Arbor* (about 15 minutes from Brixen). Benjamin explains what makes bread sustainable and good. For example, ancient grains are especially important. 👉You can read the blog article about sustainable bread here PS: We have also put together some tips for sustainable snacks when hiking. #5 Decoration At Green PearlsⓇ hotels and accommodations, you will often find ingenious decorating ideas that we have already discussed several times here on the blog. What’s great about them is that they are often DIY projects, natural products or upcycles, and that you can easily recreate many of them at home: #6 Breakfast Have you ever only eaten breakfast at a hotel? Internationally, hotels are often among the best places to have breakfast, surprising you with a nice atmosphere and many delicacies. Sustainable hotels like the SCHWARZWALD PANORAMA in Bad Herrenalb, Germany, offer a completely waste-free breakfast buffet. A hybrid of buffet and table service has also proven to be ecologically sound – egg dishes, for example, are guaranteed fresh and nothing needs to be thrown away. 👉Learn more about breakfast at sustainable hotels By the way: Have you ever made your own hummus? This vegan power breakfast from the Levant is easy to make, as the Paradiso Pure.Living Vegan Hotel* on the Seiser Alm in South Tyrol shows. #7 Honey Many sustainable hotels have made a commitment to protect the bees and care for hives. The sweet reward is the honey that many of them produce. The APIPURA hotel rinner* on the Ritten in South Tyrol is at the forefront. The hotel is run by passionate beekeeper Paul Rinner and his family. In addition to the hotel’s own organic honey, the hotel also offers Api-Wellness, where guests can inhale the air from the beehive. The hotel has been around for 50 years and has been committed to biodiversity and bee conservation since before the bee hype. 👉Learn more about the power of honey. #8 Coffee We spoke to Viennese barista Moritz Unterlechner of the Unterlechner family, who run the Biohotel Grafenast in Vienna, about the sustainable coffee trends for 2024/2025. He recommends the organic coffee beans (espresso and filter coffee) from BOB & Co. The German Green City Hotel Vauban in Freiburg is an integration company and therefore works with other integration companies whenever possible, such as the coffee roaster Zollernalb.. 👉Discover sustainable coffee trends here #9 Clothes Hanger The SCHWARZWALD PANORAMA is increasingly designing the interior of the hotel with a closed cycle of raw materials in mind, and has now renovated an entire floor according to the cradle-to-cradleⓇ principle. It is important that all materials are either biodegradable or 100% recyclable. 👉In this Insight, they present their hangers made of meadow grass. #10 Lamp Shades Other cool things can be made from grass, hay and hay flowers. The Hotel Klosterbräu, for example, uses bedside lamps made of hay flowers in its nature rooms. The nature rooms are made entirely from natural and local materials – the wood comes from the hotel’s own forest and the walls are plastered with local clay. 👉Learn more about hayflower lampshades here. #11 Marmalades and jams Do you know the difference between jam, marmalade, jelly and fruit spread? Well, this summer we explained it on our blog and also featured delicious sweet spreads from our Green Pearls partners – with recipes, of course. Homemade jam from local fruits is not only delicious, but also a zero waste product! 👉Read about jams, jellies and marmalades here. #12 Natural Cosmetics In sustainable accommodations, you shouldn’t find disposable products in the bathroom. The small bottles and tubes that are still available in many conventional hotels not only create a lot of waste, they often contain hazardous substances and microplastics. Some hotels, like the ADLER Lodge RITTEN*, even make their own line of cosmetics, with ingrediance right from the region. That way they know exactly what is in it. Learn more in our article about natural cosmetics in hotels. For background information, we also recommend the article how beauty care and environment are related. 👉The Green DIY Spa Day article even includes recipes you can try at home. #13 Olives Olives grow throughout the Mediterranean, and for many of our southern partners, the olive harvest is an annual highlight. Relais del Maro in Liguria*, for example, hosts an olive festival every November in the coastal town of Imperia. At the festival, you can taste a wide variety of olives. Of course, the region’s famous Taggiasca olives are also available at the Albergo Diffuso, a 4-star hotel spread over several buildings in the village for a truly authentic Italian experience. 👉Read more about olives in Italy and Spain. #14 Plant-based drink Cow’s milk has a high carbon footprint due to the way cows are raised. But are vegan milk alternatives really greener? Hotels such as the 100% vegan, adults-only LA VIMEA* in South Tyrol have long offered guests a wide range of plant-based drinks for their coffee. Now, a “cappuccino with oat drink” is a staple on the menus of other hotels as well. 👉Find out if this is better for the environment with our sustainability check for plant-based beverages. #15 Carpets “Even though our carpets are trampled on, we still pay a lot of attention to sustainability, design and the concept behind them when making our selections”. This is how the Hotel Luise in Erlangen, Germany, describes its policy. The hotel uses carpet tiles from Interface (locations in Germany, Austria and Switzerland). Interface focuses on circular carpets made from recycled materials. The “NetEffect” carpet tiles, for example, are made from recycled fishing nets. According to various studies, abandoned or lost fishing nets make up the largest proportion of marine plastic. The Lifestylehotel SAND in Timmendorfer Strand also has Interface carpet tiles. The adults-only hotel chose a model made of post- and pre-consumer PET to match the hotel’s natural Baltic Sea style. 👉Learn more about carpets made from fishing nets #16 STUA Furniture Sustainable furniture is also a hallmark of green accommodations. Many Green PearlsⓇ hotels feature restored antiques or furniture made by a local carpenter using local wood. The OCEANO Health Spa Hotel in Tenerife recommends the Spanish furniture brand STUA, which is also available in stores. 👉Learn more about STUA furniture. #17 Tea Strictly speaking, only the leaves of the tea plant are tea – but in German-speaking countries, other infusions made from herbs, spices and flowers are also called “tea”. You can easily brew these in a carbon-neutral way using the plants on your balcony! 👉Learn more in our blog article about tea, where we also reveal the blends of some of the hotels. #18 Vases Every hotel lobby should have at least one beautiful vase of fresh flowers. But to be sustainable, you need two things: first, a sustainable vase (at the Klosterhof – Alpine Hideaway & Spa in Bayerisch Gmain, these are made by a local artist who uses a 3D printer to create vases out of coffee grounds). And second, sustainable flowers. STURM in Mellrichstadt introduced us to the Slow Flower movement. 👉Hier siehst du die Vasen aus Kaffeesatz “I saw this in a Green PearlsⓇ hotel” By the way, the reason I find sustainable hotel products so cool is that they are so beautiful to show off 🙂 They combine your travels with individuality, with the skills of professional interior designers and of course with a love for our planet. So the products listed here won’t be the last you’ll find on the blog. Do you already have an idea of what we should include? *CIN-Codes: IT021072A1QCJQTLUQ (ADLER Lodge Ritten) IT021011A1AE4737IT (My Arbor) IT008010A1NIWKHTTF (Relais del Maro) IT021072A1UOWUIDH4 (APIPURA hotel rinner) IT021056A1J4HHYSU4 (LA VIMEA) IT021019A16MFGOUCR (Paradiso Pure.Living Vegan Hotel) Save this article to Pinterest."
The 5 most beautiful eco-luxury hotels in the Alps,"Did you know that some of our Green PearlsⓇ hotels are designated Sites of Power? Or that they offer guided tours/hikes to recognized places of power in their area? Find out what they are here. But not only these places of power have a special effect: we also show you some special natural sites that will definitely invite you to stop and reflect. What is a place of power? “Places of power are in vogue. But their effects are not scientifically proven.” SRF in its article on magical nature A place of power is a geographical location in nature where, according to esoteric belief, a particular energy or earth radiation exists. Scientific methods cannot prove this; instead, people identify such places using a pendulum or divining rod.People also designate some power places based on ley lines or Feng Shui principles. Some (or many) also use the term for places in nature that are simply beautiful and subjectively uplifting. You can probably think of an example right now, can’t you? Places of power and tourism Powerful sites are key attractions in the tourism industry—take Stonehenge, for example! In 2019, authorities closed Ayers Rock in Uluru-Kata Tjuta National Park after the Anangu people protested. They opposed the increasing number of tourists climbing their sacred mountain, damaging the environment, and trampling on their cultural heritage. Uluru holds deep cultural and religious significance for Australia’s indigenous people. However, with our Green PearlsⓇ partners, we don’t get the impression that power places are being exploited for tourism. Instead, they often align with the personal worldview of the individual hotel hosts, particularly in the case of Feng Shui power places. Lifestyle Resort Zum Kurfürsten – An entire hotel as a Feng Shui place of power “The entire hotel has been declared a place of power by a Feng Shui master from Beijing.” – Zum Kurfürsten Lifestyle Resort Feng Shui and TCM play an important role at Lifestyle Resort Zum Kurfürsten. The wellness hotel in Bernkastel-Kues on the Mosel River used to be a simple hotel for coach tours – until Heiner Buckermann took over and transformed it into the lifestyle resort it is today. Today, it boasts a 4,500-square-foot wellness area with saunas, pools and a natural swimming pond, as well as a diet based on the Five Elements and TCM therapy. Heiner Buckermann remembers the construction phase and the Feng Shui master: “The master was visiting Germany from Beijing and met one of our TCM therapists. We were building at the time and asked for his help. The master explained the details of how to connect the energies in the place of power.” The goal was to ensure that the entire place stayed coherent and, like a turtle’s shell, blocked negative energies. To achieve this, they directed the water from the various pools to flow in a specific way, and followed precise instructions on maintaining contact with the street or hotel staircase to protect the energy of the Power Place. By connecting all the outbuildings to the main building, the energy can “flow freely”. The choice of materials, the polygonal tiles, the nine flags on the street – everything follows the Feng Shui rules for a place of power. According to Heiner Buckermann, the Feng Shui instructions were all “logical” and “pleasant” and “contributed positively to the design of the hotel. The master himself then declared the entire hotel to be a place of power, and anyone sensitive to this can still feel it today. Biohotel Grafenast – A place of power, confirmed by geomancers Peter Unterlechner of the Biohotel Grafenast in Tyrol, Austria, also believes in flowing qi and has had the hotel, now in its third generation, aligned accordingly. “We had the grounds designed according to Feng Shui and then had them tested by a geomancer,” says Peter Unterlechner. The geomancer confirmed that both the hotel and the surrounding nature are places of power. The hotel sits beautifully in the mountains, offering stunning views of the valley. “The panoramic location and the combination of an old house and a fresh spirit bring the power to life and make it tangible” – Biohotel Grafenast You can create your own places of power As you can see from the examples, you can create your own places of power by implementing certain esoteric rules. “We have created various places of power ourselves,” reports the HUBERTUS Mountain Refugio Allgäu. There are various retreats in the wellness area of the Mountain Spring Spa and the “Power of Silence” place with a bonsai tree. The sustainably managed hotel is also an advocate of Ayurveda and mindfulness, offering yoga classes and retreats throughout the year. At Naturhotel Gerbehof, the owners strongly believe in the Philippi method. They offer bioenergetic motivation sessions in-house, and there is a stone circle in their private forest where guests can experience a “meditation on the four primary elements.” Crystal Garden at Gut Guntrams If you are interested in crystals, the Gut Guntrams near Vienna has an impressive crystal garden with some huge exhibits. However, owner Stefan Gergley does not make any esoteric connections. He simply has a passion for crystals, petrified wood and minerals, he explains, and shares them in his private collection and his own nature museum at Gut Guntrams. Places of power around sustainable hotels Many Green PearlsⓇ accommodations are located near one or more places of power. The way these sites are transformed into a tourist experience varies widely. The “Snake God’s” place of worship must not be disturbed For example, Rajiv Desraj Shrestha, general manager of The Pavilions Himalayas – The Farm in Nepal, knows of a place of power near the resort – but he won’t take you there because he thinks tourists (and people in general) are a disruptive factor. “We have a place of power. It is a very old place of worship according to Hindu understanding, dedicated to the ‘Snake God’ and according to Hinduism can only be worshipped on certain auspicious days. In general, it is disturbed by human presence and therefore a visit is not recommended.” – Rajiv Desraj Shrestha Temples and the “holy forest” to experience in Thailand At Keemala in Phuket, on the other hand, the surrounding power spots are integrated into the program. They tell us there are three areas: The enchantingly beautiful Keemala Resort is nestled in the tropical forest of Phuket. Guests of the Hotel Weihrerhof in South Tyrol will receive a “power places booklet”. The Pichler family, who run the Hotel Weihrerhof* on the shores of Lake Costalovara in Renon, South Tyrol, actively sought out places of natural power in the area around their hotel. This came about because the host family carefully studied the surrounding nature. Of particular interest are the Celtic-Rhaetian sites and settlements typical of the Ritten. When exploring places of power, their goal is to “feel more and think less”. In order to understand the energy involved, they have enlisted the help of geomancer Bernd Traber. As a guest, you will find a small booklet in your room in which you can learn more about each place and get ideas for consciously experiencing them. Afterwards you can visit them with a new feeling and let nature have a deeper effect on you. Hotel room design inspired by a place of power in Bad Herrenalb The SCHWARZWALD PANORAMA has just renovated its hotel rooms (according to Cradle to Cradle™) and created the room category “Falkenstein”. The Falkenstein is a local landmark in Bad Herrenalb, and according to hotel owner Stephan Bode, the “vibrating primeval energy” is particularly noticeable here. He wanted the new hotel rooms to reflect this: “As soon as you enter the room, you feel a unique and unbridled energy – powerful and balanced. Falkenstein is the perfect design concept for every guest who wants to feel primal power.” Bad Herrenalb – a place of power There are also other places of power in the area, such as one “directly above the junction of the two supercontinents of Gondwana and Laurasia”. The entire town of Bad Herrenalb is considered a healing place of power, evident from the unusually large number of twin trees, a wonder pine growing on an archway, and its healing water and climate. The hotel team emphasizes that you don’t have to believe in the special power of Bad Herrenalb to feel it: “Even guests unfamiliar with the special qualities of the place often confirm at check-out that they feel relaxed and energized.” – SCHWARZWALD PANORAMA Recharge your batteries in Warper Wood Sisters Maren Geisler-Okelmann and Kristin Okelmann of eco-hotel Okelmann’s in Warpe are spiritually open. The water that flows through their pipes has been revitalized using the Grander method, and the hotel offers yoga, meditation, and sound massages. “Our power spot, almost on our doorstep, is the magical Warper Wood. We do some retreats that include forest bathing. We spend as much time there as possible.” – Hotel Okelmanns “Heartstone” Place of Power near Hotel Klosterhof – Alpine Hideaway & Spa The health hotel Klosterhof – Alpine Hideaway & Spa has a focus on medicine and is happy to offer scientifically based methods (e.g. medical liver fasting instead of other types of fasting). Additionally, you can participate in a guided forest bathing tour. The guide Jana likes to integrate the power place Herzstein into her tour. It is only a 5 minute walk from the hotel. Lisa-Maria Standl from the hotel says: “I’ve been there several times, and even though it’s a bit esoteric, I think the word ‘place of power’ is appropriate. Hexenbödele on the Ritten in South Tyrol Near the APIPURA hotel rinner* on the Ritten in South Tyrol, there is a mystical place called “Hexenbödele”. It is a forest clearing with a larch tree in the middle. Legend says that devils and witches once danced here. One night, a young boy, wanting to prove his courage, visited the place. By morning, they found him lifeless—trampled to death by the witches. After this tragic event, they hung a crucifix in the larch tree to honor the boy, and since then, the witches are said to avoid the place. In addition to the Hexenböderle, Karin Rinner from the hotel’s host family recommends the Waldner Eck and the Mitterstieler See viewpoint. “I often visit the places of power around us because they are breathtaking sites where you can get a lot of strength.” – Karin Rinner Stone circle in Seefeld In Seefeld, where the sustainable Hotel Klosterbräu is located, there is a stone circle as a place of power. They built it on the Pfarrerbichl as a “magical place.” In 2000, they measured the constellation, and in 2007, they inaugurated the place of power. The 12 stones are meant to represent the 12 apostles, and in the middle, there is a way of the cross, starting from the parish church in Seefeld. The Hotel Klosterbräu was built on the 500-year-old walls of an old monastery. The staff here likes to play with biblical names. The sunbathing area by the outdoor pool is called the “Garden of Eden.” And down in the vaults is the “Cellar of Sin“. Places of natural power with our Green PearlsⓇ partners As we researched the places of power among our Green PearlsⓇ partners, many emphasized the natural treasures of their surroundings. The sea as an inexhaustible source of energy in Tenerife At the OCÉANO Health Spa Hotel on the island of Tenerife, they believe that the Atlantic Ocean, which borders the hotel, is a powerful source of energy. “The sea gives peace and strength. You can feel and experience this source of strength and find your own rhythm.” – OCÉANO Health Spa Hotel The sea also plays an important role in the various health therapies offered by the hotel, such as “Ocean Balancing” or “Thalasso”. Subjective places of power in East Tyrol The Naturhotel Outside in Matrei in East Tyrol immediately named four places that, in their opinion, are suitable for subjective experience as a place of power.: The best way to experience the power of the East Tyrolean Alps is by hiking. The Outside Nature Hotel is an official hiking hotel located in the heart of the Hohe Tauern National Park. Find out more in our interview with hiking concierge Karin Steiner. Place of Power Matterhorn Switzerland’s most famous mountain, the Matterhorn, is also often described as a “place of power” – with no esoteric overtones. “The mountain is often seen as a place that gives people energy and inspiration,” reports the CERVO Mountain Resort in Zermatt. The nature-oriented design resort offers direct views of the Swiss landmark. Recharge your batteries with a forest bath in South Tyrol At the adults-only wellness hotel My Arbor*, the surrounding forest is mentioned. It not only provides “a picturesque backdrop for the hotel,” but also “a retreat full of peace and natural energy. My Arbor offers forest bathing at least once a week as part of its weekly program. “Forest bathing is a wonderful way to reduce stress, clear the mind and harmonize body and soul. The soothing effects of the trees and pure mountain air are appreciated by many of our guests.” – My Arbor The Riva Waterfalls in Sand in Taufers From the energy-self-sufficient OLM Nature Escape* in Sand in Taufers, South Tyrol, it is only a 30-minute walk to the Reinbach Waterfalls. These are three spectacular waterfalls in the Tauferer Ahrntal. The upper and middle ones are about 50 meters high and the lower one is over 10 meters high. According to OLM Nature Escape, the Reinbach Waterfalls are one of the most beautiful destinations in the area. Definitely an energizing place to recharge your batteries. The aparthotel itself is also a special place – the round building blends harmoniously into nature. Do places of power work? Many people visit a place of power and “recharge their batteries” – from nature, from pausing, from consciously pausing. There are scientists who are trying to scientifically prove the healing effects of nature (e.g. through forest bathing). There are already some indications, such as the reduction of stress hormones or a positive effect on the cardiovascular or immune system. However, we are talking about nature in general, not “places of power”. The most important thing is that both “official” and purely subjective places of power are always a personal feeling in the sense of “that does me good”, “that gives me strength.” Visitors to places of power do not need scientific proof of this. *CIN CODES Italien IT021072A1L46PNBHX (Hotel Weihrerhof) IT021072A1UOWUIDH4 (APIPURA hotel rinner) IT021011A1AE4737IT (My Arbor) IT021017B4CPKU6WK9 (OLM Nature Escape) Save this article as an inspiration for your next journey!"
Vacation by bike: Ideas for the world bicycle day,"The year is drawing to a close. Perhaps you are already in the midst of Christmas preparations and baking your first cookies for the Advent plate? As much as we look forward to this season of cookies, gingerbread, and feasting, some of us are already feeling the urge to do something for our health after the holiday frenzy and, if possible, make a fresh start. But instead of feeling guilty and booking the first “detox” that comes along after the holidays, you can plan your fasting vacation for 2025 now. To make it easier for you, we answer the most frequently asked questions about fasting on vacation and introduce you to the fasting programs offered by sustainable hotels. All you have to do is book 😉 How can I fast in a sustainable way? Fasting (we are referring to therapeutic fasting, not religious fasting) means going without food for a period of time, either completely or partially, to give the body time to detoxify and cleanse itself. A desired effect is that after fasting you will eat more consciously and perhaps use food and other resources more consciously. 👉 You can read our article “Sustainable fasting?” here, where we explain different types of fasting, give you tips for your fasting cure, and also discuss what this has to do with sustainability. Therapeutic fasting is one of the options for a healthy and conscious lifestyle. Therefore, it makes sense to choose a sustainable hotel for your fasting vacation. By combining your fasting cure with a stay in a sustainable hotel, you can be sure that aspects such as sustainable energy production, CO2 reduction and organic food are taken into account. Why combine fasting and vacations at all? Of course, you can do a healing fast at home on your own – and even go to work and go about your usual daily routine. But anyone who’s tried it (like me) will tell you it’s not the best idea. Often you don’t just want to avoid food, but you also want to take a step back from other things and find some time to rest and reflect. Many people associate vacations with fun and “indulging” – but taking care of your health while traveling has become a trend, and indulging and enjoying increasingly means doing what is good for you. Fasting on vacation is easier and has many advantages: How much does a fasting vacation cost? For a hotel fasting retreat, including accommodation, fasting meals, support, spa and program, you should expect to pay around 1000 Euros per week. You can find an approximate price for each hotel here in the article. Exact prices are available through the links provided or upon request. Fasting vacation in Tenerife 2025 according to F. X. Mayr The OCÉANO Health Spa Hotel on Tenerife has an affiliated F.X. Mayr Center – especially for fasting guests! This means that when you come here, you can enjoy the amenities of the hotel, such as the swimming pool, seawater pool, gym and yoga classes – but when it comes to “eating” and other activities, you will only be with other people who are fasting. You will be cared for by trained therapists and doctors in a picturesque setting between the Atlantic Ocean and volcanic mountains. In 2025, three types of fasting cures will be offered: Dates in 2025: Classic: 14 or 21 days; Detox: 10, 14 or 21 days; Active: 10, 14 or 21 days – All treatments are available year round.

Price: From 740 Euros (5 nights) #3 Liver fasting at the Klosterhof – Alpine Hideaway & Spa At Klosterhof – Alpine Hideaway & Spa, Dr. Andreas Färber combines his medical health center with a wellness hotel. The location in the Berchtesgadener Land is not only ideal for hiking, but with its alpine nature it also provides the perfect setting for fasting retreats. During your fasting retreat, you will enjoy the personal attention of your host, Dr. Andreas Färber, and his team of nutritional specialists. Liver fasting according to Dr Worm Together with TV-nutrition expert Isabell Heßmann, Dr. Andreas Färber offers regular group retreats on liver fasting according to Dr Worm. Liver fasting helps to prevent fatty liver and high cholesterol levels and is the ideal way to get rid of bad eating habits. Liver fasting according to Dr Nicolai Worm involves 3 daily meals (shakes) and 2 snack times (vegetables). This helps to keep your insulin levels constantly low and thus promotes the breakdown of fat in the liver. You will be supported throughout the entire fasting week and receive additional cookery events, lectures, materials and your progress will be reviewed individually. Dates 2025: The next retreat will take place from 16 – 23 March 2025. Click here to book. Price: from 1,820 euros per person in a double room / 2,443 euros per person in a double room (7 nights) Fasting vacation at the Biohotel Grafenast in Tyrol High up in the Biohotel Grafenast, you have a magnificent view of the Inn Valley.

Dates in 2025: Price: Seminar costs for the Ayurvedic fasting week in April: 420 euros, accommodation and fasting meals from 123 euros per day Sustainable hotels that support you during your customized fasting program If you don’t need a group for your fasting cure, but would like to have individual support and a pleasant vacation atmosphere for yourself, then this is possible, for example, at the CERVO Mountain Resort in Zermatt, Switzerland. If you wish, you can have your personal fasting program designed and carried out here. Zermatt, at the foot of the Matterhorn, is car-free and considered one of the most beautiful villages in Switzerland. The resort has a beautiful spa area with a wide range of treatments to support your fasting program. Individual fasting is also possible at My Arbor* in South Tyrol on the Plose. “We are happy to support our guests who are fasting,” says the adults-only hotel. Special dietary requirements are part of the “My Concept”, where guests are individually catered for and staff trained accordingly. A final tip for fasting You should do a therapeutic fasting program in an appropriate setting and not squeeze it into your daily routine. It is said: “When we are young, we waste our health to make money, and when we are old, we spend our money on health.” It doesn’t have to be this way. Fasting for health is primarily for healthy people and is a preventative measure that can benefit people with poor eating habits, overweight, stress, and digestive problems. The money you spend on a fasting vacation is therefore an investment in your own health and can contribute to a more conscious and sustainable lifestyle in general. *CIN Code: IT021011A1AE4737IT (My Arbor) Save this article for planning your sustainable fasting cure 2025!"
Green Wedding: special places for a special day,"One of the descriptions of paradise in the Qur’an is that you won’t hear idle talk or lies there (78:35). Isn’t that wonderful? And certainly no construction noise – which plagues me as I write this. Work has started on an underground car park and a multi-storey building right next to us. So now, when I think of a holiday, the first thing I think of is SILENCE! How nice that several Green PearlsⓇ accommodations are located in such a quiet and secluded area. Sustainable hotels offering silent retreats Does silence need any kind of instruction? Not really. Later in this article we give you a list of hotels and accommodations in quiet, open natural settings – where you can easily experience silence for yourself. But many of us are already so ‘programmed’ that we are constantly busy with our phones, work, family or other things. In most cases, “time for yourself” means putting on some music and getting on the treadmill. But have you ever consciously allowed yourself to experience silence? Without music, radio, television, screaming children and chattering partners? When was the last time you did that? And “endured” it for an extended period of time? Well? Got you? In such situations, it can be helpful to find and consciously experience silence with a professional trainer. Don’t worry, it’s going to be quiet now. Personal retreat at Gut Guntrams in Austria Gut Gunstram is situated about an hour from Vienna in the middle of an orchard. A 25 minute walk from the nearest train station, you will find yourself in a wonderfully relaxed atmosphere with a natural swimming pond and crystal garden. You can book a silent retreat with Petra Kaltenböck as a one-to-one retreat at any time. Petra is a professional horse guide and selfness coach with over ten years of experience. “Guidance (means) we will walk a path together in which you will come more and more into contact with your own strength! (…) It takes what it needs. (…) Sometimes it’s just being together in silence and awareness.” – Petra Kaltenböck 👉 Find out more about the retreat here. Fasting weeks with quiet moments at Biohotel Grafenast The Biohotel Grafenast in Tyrol is also a dream location for moments of tranquillity. This small, family-run hotel, with just 23 rooms, is situated high above the Tyrolean Inn Valley and offers breathtaking views of the surrounding countryside. The eco-hotel recommends its fasting weeks as a way of experiencing silence, where ‘silent moments’ are an integral part of the programme: 👉Next date: April 2025 Ayurvedic fasting week with Isolde Ackermann That’s why silence is good for you According to the Spectrum of Science, numerous studies have shown a link between long-term noise exposure and cardiovascular disease. This has led to noise legislation in several countries. Silence, on the other hand, allows the brain to “better regenerate its cognitive resources”. Silence clears the mind and helps you organise your thoughts and develop new ideas. Ocean Balancing – Silence in the water Of course, there is no such thing as 100% silence in nature. Leaves rustle, birds chirp – and for most of us, even distant traffic noise is part of everyday life. You can always hear something. But as scientific studies show, the level of noise makes a big difference to our brains. So-called ‘floating tanks’ are used for scientific research involving silence. Subjects are placed in salt water tanks with sound and light proof hoods and left to float for a period of time, shielded from the outside world. (Personally, I think that would be a bit too much for me!) At the OCÉANO Health Spa Hotel in Tenerife, you can find peace and tranquillity in the open air with the OCEAN Balancing treatment. During this “treatment of deep and lasting relaxation”, you will float in water, accompanied by a therapist. Your muscles relax, the water muffles the sounds and the calm connection with the element of water gives you new impulses. Room of tranquillity as a counterpart to the relaxation room Many spa hotels have quiet rooms. But the Hotel Das Rübezahl in Allgäu (with a direct view of Neuschwanstein Castle) has found that a quiet room next to the sauna is not quiet enough. People tend to chat there. So the hotel’s ‘Boutique Spa’ now includes a ‘Room of Silence’ where it really is quiet. STURM in Mellrichstadt has named its quiet room the ‘House of Silence’. It was recently designed by the renowned architect Professor Matthias Loebermann and is completely paneled with natural silver fir. You enter the room, located in the garden next to the outdoor sauna, through a long corridor. This transition is designed to trigger a mental reset and prepare you for the silence to come. Time to unwind. And relax. At Eco-Hotel Okelmann’s in the small town of Warpe in Lower Saxony, you can find peace and tranquillity in nature and through yoga and meditation. Maren Geisler-Okelmann, a member of the host family, is a qualified yoga teacher. “We have a room of silence that is used for ‘just being’ and meditation.” – Hotel Okelmann’s Room of Tranquillity on holidays The SCHWARZWALD PANORAMA in Bad Herrenalb is another hotel that promotes mindfulness with its Selfness Centre. However, the ‘Room of Tranquillity’ is reserved specifically for Christian holidays: Easter, Christmas and New Year. The room offers with yoga mats, atmospheric decor and a reading corner. “This way, our guests can escape the hustle and bustle of their holidays and find peace,” the hotel says. Relax & Calm’ – Sustainable wellness hotels with multiple quiet rooms The slightly larger properties of our sustainable Green PearlsⓇ partners are also ideal for a relaxing holiday in peaceful surroundings. The Lifestyle Resort Zum Kurfürsten in Bernkastel-Kues on the Mosel River, for example, was designed entirely according to Feng Shui principles and includes numerous relaxation rooms. 👉 Learn more about the lifestyle resort’s “Relax & Calm” concept here. At the Birkenhof***** Spa & Genussresort in the Upper Palatinate, you will also find a spacious hotel with a large outdoor area. The Spa & Genussresort is beautifully secluded on a hill in the Upper Palatinate Lake District. “We have many quiet rooms for perfect relaxation,” says the owner family. At CERVO Mountain Resort in Zermatt, Switzerland, they also believe that special retreats are not necessarily required for moments of silence. “Guests seeking peace and relaxation will find the mountains to be the perfect place to unwind in silence. Our yurts, relaxation room and ritual room (outside of yoga classes) are perfect for enjoying this tranquility.” – CERVO Mountain Resort Nature-oriented hotels and vacation homes where you can find silence According to the staff, the Silence Room at Keemala’s Mala Spa in Phuket, Thailand, is always very quiet because it is only open to guests who have booked a treatment at the spa. There are other quiet corners throughout the resort, which is tucked away in the backcountry in the middle of a small tropical forest. The hotel team recommends walking barefoot through the Enchanted Forest to heighten your awareness of nature. The Gerbehof Nature Resort in Friedrichshafen on Lake Constance in Germany also cites its “own forest” as the best place to enjoy silence. There is also a “room of silence” in the house itself. The resort also has a stone circle on the grounds. “In our house, every room is silent” That’s how Marco Spiss describes his Summit Lodges in the Tyrolean village of Pfunds. The two log cabins are located in the middle of quiet nature, and you (and your loved ones) will have a large wooden house of about 120 square meters to yourself – with a sauna and a fireplace. In the evening you can sit on the balcony and listen to the rabbit and the hedgehog saying good night to each other. The My Arbor* Hotel in South Tyrol near Brixen is an adults-only hotel and a good address if you are looking for a relaxed and quiet atmosphere. “We don’t currently offer any special ‘quiet retreats’ or ‘quiet rooms’ (but) of course there are many quiet corners in the hotel where our guests can enjoy moments of silence and relaxation – be it in our spacious spa area, on a walk through the surrounding woods or in the peaceful atmosphere of our suites,” they say. By the way, the construction noise stopped when I reached the end of the article. The good man with the hydraulic hammer seems to be done for the day. Thank you very much! It is possible to actively enjoy the silence at home during a moment like this. Why not try it right now?

Impressive Thailand: visiting the Black Lahu in Ban Jabo,"Have you always dreamed of a beach eco wedding? Fortunately, such symbolic ceremonies abroad are no longer uncommon these days. Barefoot in the sand or under palm trees – we introduce you to five very special locations that host traditional ceremonies and ensure you unforgettable moments on the most beautiful day of your life! Coconut water for eternal happiness The Amaya Beach Resort & Spa on Sri Lanka’s east coast offers a traditional Poruwa ceremony. On the way to the Poruwa, a colorfully decorated altar, the bridal couple is accompanied by dancers and drum sounds. The sacred union of the two is symbolized by binding their ring fingers or little fingers and holy water pouring. The coconut water of a split coconut is dribbled on the couple to augur a prosper future. A choir solemnly blesses the marriage with chants. Finally, bride and groom light an oil lamp to send their wishes to the universe. If you’d rather celebrate a traditional western wedding but don’t want to miss the impressive scenery of Sri Lanka, you’ll find what you’re looking for at Amaya Hunas Falls. Buddha’s blessing: three times I do in Thailand Traditionally, a drum parade accompanies the bride and groom to the wedding ceremony in Thailand. Thai weddings are strongly influenced by Buddhism, so the singing and blessing of Buddhist monks open the ceremony. Holy water symbolizes a healthy and successful life which is poured over the bridal couple. Decorated chains bind the two together and symbolize the unity of the lovers. At The Tongsai Bay, you can celebrate a traditional Buddhist wedding – with guests or just the two of you. If you choose the ceremony for two, your day ends with a romantic dinner on the beach. An unforgettable experience! At Zeavola Resort the bridal couple can choose between a traditional western or Buddhist wedding. Respecting the monks’ daily routine, the symbolic Buddhist wedding usually takes place in the afternoon. The ceremony ends with the planting of a love tree, that – just like the love between bride and groom – continues to grow. By the way, if you wish to hold a legally binding wedding rather than just a ceremonial one, Zeavola Resort will help you with the required documents and administrative formalities in Bangkok. Besides traditional Buddhist weddings, you can also experience an enchanted jungle wedding at Keemala Resort. Under the centuries-old trees in the unspoiled forest, couples can celebrate a fairytale-like wedding that doesn’t explicitly follow Thai traditions, but appreciates nature as well as the bond of love. Wedded under palm trees On Cerf Island, the European influences from the colonial era can be seen when it comes to wedding ceremonies. Though, European wedding rites merge with local charm here: The bridal couple is welcomed with coconut drinks, can marry right at the turquoise blue sea or under palm trees, depending on their wishes. Instead of roses, tropical flowers adorn the bridal couple. Lovers can also plant heart-shaped corals – a romantic gesture and species protection at the same time.

5 accommodations for sustainable sleep in ancient masonry,"The year has just started and we are happy to present our travel calendar for 2019: suggesting twelve inspiring destinations that make for a perfect holiday experience – no matter when you travel. However, we would not  be the Green Travel Blog if these tips were not about sustainable travel issues: recently, we shared with you the consequences of over-tourism and the benefits of traveling off-season. Today’s tips may inspire you collecting unique holiday memories during the “uncommon” seasons throughout the year. Enjoy planning your holidays 🙂 January Traveling in the monsoon season bears two advantages: fewer tourists and lush greenery! In the rainforest you probably won’t notice the rainy season much, because it is quite humid anyway 😉 Hence, our tip for January: Peru. In the Andean region, the monsoon season usually lasts until May. You can stay amidst the rain forest at the Inkaterra Reserva Amazónica and enjoy an impressive view of the Andes and the Sacred Valley of the Incas from the Inkaterra Hacienda Urubamba. February February – neither winter nor spring. Freiburg, however, does not need spring to charm the pants off its visitors. The charismatic city center has a lot to offer; especially the historic architecture, the Freiburger Bächle (a stream running through the whole city) and the weekly market around the Freiburg Cathedral are among the city’s landmarks. In Freiburg’s eco-district Vauban, you can check in the sustainable Green City Hotel Vauban after an eventful day. Best of all: Whether winter or spring-like temperatures – you can visit the beautiful Black Forest at any time easily from here. March In the snow-sure region of Balderschwang, you can enjoy cross-country skiing until the end of March. Until March 28, 2019, you can book the winter sports offer “Spurwechsel” (English: lane change) with the HUBERTUS Alpin Lodge & Spa. Together with the Nordic-Active Center you explore the beautiful winter landscape for 3 days. In total, you will stay for four nights at Hotel HUBERTUS when booking “Spurwechsel” getting indulged with a HolisticDeep spa-treatment. What more could you want? April How about forest bathing instead of the Easter egg hunt? The selfness-hotel SCHWALRZWALD PANORAMA offers this relatively new cure during the Easter season. Forest bathing has health-promoting effects on your entire organism, strengthens the immune system and is heart-balming. The meditative excursions of forest bathing into the green are specifically suitable for stress management. Moreover, the cure is most breathtaking in Bad Herrenalb, since the forest is beautifully unspoiled! May A beach holiday on the Baltic Sea in May? Why not! The sun is already shining and the beaches are not very crowded at the same time. Moreover, bathing in the (admittedly, still cold) sea promotes blood circulation and strengthens the immune system like a climate therapy. If you want to warm up afterwards, it’s best to enjoy the view of the rooftop sauna at the SAND Lifestylehotel on Timmendorfer Beach. Thailand is one of the most popular destinations in recent years – for a reason! Even during your holiday, you can take responsibility for your destination and avoid the high season to avoid mass tourism. That’s why our tip for Thailand is likewise traveling during the monsoon season. In Southern Thailand, it rains most during the European summer, but usually only a few hours per day. And time can be easily bridged at the sustainable luxury resort Zeavola on Koh Phi Phi or at the Mala Spa of Keemala on Phuket, an architectural highlight. Our tip to escape full beaches during the high season: Beach holidays at Lake Schwerin. If everyone else is at the sea, you can enjoy the sun at the lake. The ideal accommodation is the climate-positive Hotel Speicher am Ziegelsee. Lake Ziegelsee is connected to Lake Schwerin. Not only a paradise for water sports lovers, but also the perfect starting point for bike rides and walks, for example to Schwerin Castle. The best way to enjoy late summer is visiting the Dolomites! When the sunset bathes the mountains in red and gold (called “Enrosadira” by locals), you don’t want to be anywhere else. The location of the Dolomit Homes and the Dolomit Boutique Hotel is excellent for viewing the spectacle. It’s also ideal for exploring the landscape around Alta Badia on your mountain bikes or hiking. Maira Valley is specifically popular for outdoor activities in summer and winter, and neglected in autumn for no reason! The eco-village Sagna Rotonda is located amidst the untouched nature of the valley, surrounded only by mountains, meadows and forests. With one foot out the door, you can start your hikes directly through the colorful autumn forest. With a bit of luck you can even see deer in the forest! Known as a winter sports paradise and hiking oasis in summer, the Swiss village Arosa alike is appealing in autumn. The Indian summer around the Valsana Hotel & Apartments is great for relaxed hikes. Sri Lanka is regarded as one of the most enchanting and greenest countries! Here, too, we recommend traveling during the rainy season with sustainability in mind. In the northeast, the monsoon season begins in October, and, thus it only rains a few days per month. On the eastern coast in Passikudah Bay – right by the sea – Amaya Beach Resort & Spa is located. If it rains during your stay, get pampered in the spa. The best way to escape the grey November is staying at Arosea Life Balance Hotel! In bad weather, you can easily spend several days indoor and switch between the pool, hay bath, beauty treatments, massages and a huge sauna paradise on two floors. We promise, you won’t be bored! And for those among you who are “wind- and waterproof,” the South Tyrolean Ulten Valley offers plenty hiking trails. Although winter sports are classic in December and therefore have less to do with off-season travel, you may enjoy the winter holidays snowshoe hiking instead of skiing or snowboarding – and leave the hustle and bustle of the slopes behind. At the Naturhotel Outside in Matrei, you will wander across the white National Park Hohe Tauern. Also, in the Berchtesgaden Alps you can explore the snowy hiking trails in the last month of the year, and warm up in the heated outdoor pool of the Berghotel Rehlegg enjoying the view of the snow-covered mountains."
5 accommodations for sustainable sleep in ancient masonry,"When making presents, we intend to make someone happy and put a smile on his face. That way, gifts are fun. But far too often we feel obliged to make a gift, and buy random things just to hand over something. I am involved in sustainable subjects every day and, of course; don’t want to leave the issue aside when it comes to presents. And yet, I had no idea what it means to make green gifts – which is kind of sad. If you search online for green or sustainable gifts, you mostly find common gifts, yet their eco-friendly alternatives: organic and fair produced cuddly socks, scarves, lotions, candles, and treats. We dug a little deeper and present some ideas for greener gifts! Sustainability = Durability For sustainable reasons, you might consider the impact of your chosen gifts on the environment. Today, the term primarily implies environmental protection, but also embraces the preservation and protection of natural resources, biodiversity, health, human rights, labor law, and animal welfare. Let yourself be inspired by the following tips on how to make your gifts fairer, better, and greener: Tip 1 – Avoid useless gifts For the above-mentioned reasons, you might reassess if your loved ones need the gift. Be honest, most of us have more than necessary – and sometimes we only buy a present because we feel obliged. That is why our first tip is not making “nice to have” presents because it’s you duty to bring something useless (how many tea light holders does a person need?). Tip 2 – Save and protect resources Meaningless gifts needlessly use up resources and probably end up in a dusty box in your basement or on landfills. So, what about a donation or a sponsorship? Tip 3 – DIY and be creative There are no limits to creativity. A nice side effect of DIY is appreciating things again since you are not taking them for granted. Our ideas: Tip 4 – Green gifts for the wellbeing of nature, animals, & humans And in case you choose “the usual” gift (which I fully understand, because I also like to give away sweets and care products), just pick its green alternatives: Tip 5 – Buy locally In recent years, there has been a lot of criticism about large online delivery services and their poor handling of employees. So, the motto is: support your local dealer! A book from the local bookseller strengthens the regional economy, secures jobs, the people are treated well, and you get an individual and personal advice! A great thing to support by purchasing ???? And it’s the same for Tip 6 – Well being & spending time together Wellbeing is good for your health. Stress seems like the new standard just like personal top performance seems natural. The numbers of burnout diseases are not increasing by chance. That’s why well being and time are our winners: Tip 7 – Gifts from our Green Pearls Whether it’s time together or a special souvenir: you can also find unusual gift ideas at our partner hotels: Special organic souvenirs are available for example Do it yourself at the HUBERTUS Alpin Lodge & Spa Or how about a spa-holiday for two? We hope you could draw some inspiration from our ideas!"
Green Wedding: special places for a special day,"For many reasons people are excited by diving: leaving the bustle over water behind and plunging into another world of absolute silence, and fascinating sceneries with colorful animals. Unfortunately, the underwater sport can pollute the environment easily when not being considerate of the ecological conditions. A while ago, we have shown you how diving can be sustainable. This time, we present you three destinations for your sustainable diving holiday, and the ideal accommodations. Sri Lanka, the Maldives, and Thailand are the perfect places for unforgettable and unique experiences underwater. Sri Lanka’s fishes: a colorful world Situated immediately next to the beach of Pasikudah Bay, Amaya Beach Resort & Spa is the optimal starting point for divers. The characteristic shallow water in the bay is the best basis for relaxed dives. On your tours underwater, you will explore colorful coral reefs and schools of fish such as the butterflyfish, yellow striped goatfish, clownfish, stingrays, and sweetlips. The adventurous among you can also discover deeper rocky reefs and wrecks here. Back on land, you can spend the rest of the day on the golden beach and reinforce yourself for new adventures with regional dishes prepared by Amaya Beach Resort. Underwater on the Maldives The Maldives are a divine place for divers. Crystal clear water and various kinds of fish living in the coral reefs of the Indian Ocean await you here. You not only see small fishes here, but also sharks, whale sharks, and dolphins. You can book diving classes and guided dives (at day and night) at Reethi Beach Resort in the Baa Atoll. There, you explore various reefs such as coral reefs in shallow water, atoll reefs, or outer reefs. Our tip: dive with mantas in UNESCO biosphere reserve Hanifaru Bay. Around Reethi Beach Resort’s sheds, you also find the house reefs, characteristically found close to beaches and perfect for snorkeling. Sea anemones and wrecks: diving in Thailand Thailand is one of the most traveled destinations lately and a great place for divers. Keemala Beach is a paradise for water sports as the swell varies among the seasons. Specifically, divers are happy here, no matter if you are experienced or a beginner, because there is a diving school right at the beach. Popular destinations for the dives particularly worthwhile are the anemone reef, located around the Racha Islands, the king cruiser wreck, or the famous Phi Phi Islands. Just a stone’s throw from the beach, you can find the charming green pearl Keemala. There is no better place to indulge yourself in the hotel’s SPA after diving and to enjoy the sunset."
The 5 most beautiful eco-luxury hotels in the Alps,"Clean beaches and seas, unspoiled nature in the mountains – that’s what tourists want. And hotels want to deliver. The problem is that the hotel industry itself is a major source of plastic waste. Single-use plastics in the form of typical hotel slippers, small packages in the bathroom and at the buffet, along with straws and cups, add up to mountains of plastic in conventional hotels. We took a look at sustainable Green PearlsⓇ hotels, what alternatives are available and how to avoid single-use plastics in general. The problem with disposables in hotels When you stay at a hotel, you get everything you need: your luggage is taken care of, a refreshing drink is waiting for you in your room, a variety of toiletries are available in the bathroom, towels and slippers are provided… and while you are lying by the pool or sitting in the restaurant, your room is cleaned, the bed is made and all opened tubes and packages are replaced with new ones. Sound great? For sustainability-minded travelers like you, probably not. Because: All of this (among other things) creates a lot of waste. Hotels and vacation rentals definitely have a single-use problem, and it has to do with the following:: Expensive hotels produce less waste than cheap ones According to the DEHOGA environmental brochure, 0 to 2-star hotels produce 9.1 liters of waste per guest per day, 4-star hotels 3.4 liters (5-star hotels produce slightly more at 3.7 liters). According to the German Hotel and Restaurant Association (DEHOGA), this is mainly due to disposable packaging in the lower star categories. In the upscale hotel industry, less disposable packaging is used simply for style’s sake – e.g. cloth napkins instead of paper napkins, ceramic or stainless steel milk jugs instead of plastic condensed milk containers, etc. But simply choosing a higher star rating is not enough to eliminate waste and single-use packaging. Especially since not everyone can or wants to. Above all, it takes hoteliers who really care and are committed to reducing waste in their properties. Zero waste or at least “less waste” is a central concern for Green Pearls® accommodations. Each accommodation has its own approach to waste reduction, which you can read about on the Green Pearls® pages and on their individual websites. As mentioned above, many of them are Zero Waste representatives, striving for a low environmental footprint and a circular economy in all areas. We believe that Green PearlsⓇ hotels are among the lowest waste producers in the industry. “In terms of waste and plastic reduction, sustainably certified hotels are generally more advanced than non-certified hotels.” – WWF WWF study on single-use and reusable products in the hospitality industry In 2019 and 2024, WWF Germany investigated the issue of single-use plastics in the hotel industry. For the 2019 study, WWF surveyed hotels and hotel guests in Italy, France, Greece and Spain. In 2024, the data was supplemented by expert interviews and a literature review. It found that the majority of guests use significantly more reusable packaging at home than on vacation. Hoteliers are determined to act, but face many obstacles: For every 50 million disposables, only half a million reusables are sold “In 2022, the share of reusable packaging (by number of items) in the hotel industry was only 1.2 percent. (600,000 items compared to 50.6 million disposable items) and consisted almost entirely of beverage containers.” – Untersuchung der Gesellschaft für Verpackungsmarktforschung mbH (GVM) für den WWF All too often, “habit” is to blame for not using reusable products. By the way, the WWF believes that reusable products make much more sense than disposable products made from “eco-materials”. In other words, a refillable plastic bottle is better than a disposable bamboo cup. Washable cloth napkins are better than disposable napkins made from recycled cellulose. This is how sustainable hotels avoid disposable packaging Amenities upon request Many sustainable hotels and resorts have started to remove amenities such as toothbrushes, razors, sewing kits, etc. from the rooms and store them at the front desk. That way, you still get them, but only if you really need and ask for them. “By providing standard amenities only upon request, we avoid unnecessary use,” says Farmhouse Smiling Gecko in Cambodia. The resort also offers many homemade products from the resort’s own workshops, which Smiling Gecko uses to support the local community. When it comes to the amenities that are still offered on request, sustainable accommodation also ensures that they are produced sustainably and fairly. This is what the Naturresort Gerbehof in Friedrichshafen on Lake Constance reports. Honesty bar with reusable glasses instead of a minibar The minibar is another element that must be provided to meet hotel standards. In addition to energy consumption, drinks and snacks in disposable packaging also have a negative impact on the environment. Gut Guntrams near Vienna therefore installed a “central minibar” in the form of a Honesty Bar and left the individual minibars in the rooms empty. The Honesty Bar offers homemade sweet and savory treats in reusable glass jars. Homemade welcome cookies A small welcome gift for guests is a nice touch. But as Zero Waste advocate Béá Johnson says, promotional gifts and giveaways are often a source of waste. Not so at the Hotel Bella Vista Zermatt in Switzerland. There, homemade cookies on a plate greet guests in the mountains near the Matterhorn. A water bottle for the duration of your stay Many hotels provide their guests with a refillable water bottle. At the OCÉANO Health Spa Hotel on Tenerife, the “OCÉANO Glass Bottle” is available and there are water dispensers throughout the hotel where you can refill the bottle with fresh, filtered water. This fits in with the wide range of sports and wellness activities on offer and also saves a lot of bottles and miles of transportation 🙂 Source of waste: breakfast buffet? Zero waste is also an option! One of the biggest contributors to packaging and food waste in the hotel industry is the breakfast buffet. All Green Pearls® hotels have optimized this aspect. “There are no packaged products at our breakfast buffet,” reports the APIPURA hotel rinner on the ritten in South Tyrol. Instead, the child-friendly hotel offers organic products in small jars – one of the highlights are the various types of organic honey from the hotel’s own beekeeping. Zero waste measures at the breakfast buffet: Elimination of disposable hygiene products Disposable bathroom hygiene products are the second major area where mountains of plastic waste accumulate in conventional hotels. This refers to the small packages of shampoo, shower gel, soap, body lotion, shower cap, toothbrush, razor and so on. Sustainable hotels show that these products can be provided to guests in a stylish and hygienic way and do not have to be the norm. Solid Soap and Shampoo At the Klosterhof Alpine Hideaway & Spa in Berchtesgadener Land, Bavaria, the bathroom features soap and shampoo bars, as well as refillable shower gel dispensers as an alternative to traditional bottles. You can do the same at home, by the way! Dispenser Speaking of dispensers: Another option you might want to consider for the home are refillable, larger, and often more attractive dispensers for soap, shampoo, conditioner, shower gel, and the like. According to soap manufacturer MarcelsGreenSoap, a refill bag saves 85% of plastic packaging! Almost all Green Pearls® accommodations now use dispensers – with natural ingredients. “Our shampoos and shower gels (in the dispensers) are from Tiroler Kräuterhof, so they are 100% natural and regional,” reports Summit Lodges Pfunds. Biohotel Grafenast in Tyrol even offers dispensers with arnica muscle gel for relaxation after long hikes around the Pillberg 😉 Natural cosmetics free of chemicals and microplastics For our Green PearlsⓇ partners, the use of environmentally friendly cosmetic products is very important. At Pavilions Himalayas – The Farm in Nepal, you can buy bamboo toothbrushes with hemp bristles and plastic-free toothpaste tabs made according to Ayurvedic principles, as are the other personal care products. Avoiding chemicals and microplastics is particularly important to them to protect the water quality of their organic farm.. The Green Spirit hotels in Paris (Hotel Malar, Hotel Amelie and Hotel Le Pavillon, all in the central 7th arrondissement within walking distance of the Eiffel Tower) use soaps, shampoos and shower gels from Austrian natural cosmetics company Pure Green. The luxurious Klosterbräu wellness hotel in Seefeld, Tyrol, spoils its guests with premium products from Augustinus Bader – some of which have been developed exclusively for the hotel. The Lifestylehotel SAND in Timmendorfer Strand on the Baltic Sea has embraced ‘Björk&Berries‘. Nordic, sustainable, refillable and stylish,” they say. Food from their own harvest In the hotel industry, buying food in bulk is one way to reduce unnecessary packaging. Where possible, regionally. “We work almost exclusively with local suppliers to avoid long transport routes and support the regional economy,” says My Arbor near Brixen in South Tyrol. However, food packaging is avoided in particular through direct in-house production. “From cakes to chocolates to syrups, we make everything ourselves,” explains the adults-only wellness hotel. “All our fresh fruit and vegetables come from our own farm in Albisano on Lake Garda. The owner, Mr Huber, personally takes care of the harvest and brings the produce directly to the hotel (without packaging waste) so that our guests can enjoy the freshest ingredients.” – My Arbor Dishes and glasses Disposable plastic cups at hotels? They do exist! Some hoteliers find them more convenient and less risky than glass or porcelain, especially for the lawn or pool. Unfortunately, they create a huge amount of waste. Sustainable hotels are careful to use only high-quality, plastic-free materials. The energy-independent aparthotel OLM Nature Escape in Sand in Taufers, South Tyrol, uses only glass, porcelain, ceramic, clay and enamel for food and drink. Tablecloths and napkins Just as glass and porcelain are more stylish than plastic tableware, cloth napkins are more sophisticated than paper napkins. You can find them, for example, at the Relais del Maro in Liguria. The Albergo Diffuso in the picturesque village of Borgomaro takes care to avoid waste in all areas. Consequently, linen tablecloths are washed rather than thrown away. Towel change upon request only Since laundry does not produce waste, but does use detergent, water and energy, daily hotel laundry is another factor that you, as a guest, can help with. Many guests notice that even towels that have been hung up are all replaced the next day. This calls for well-trained staff who, like at the Lifestyle Resort Zum Kurfürsten on the Mosel, change towels only when requested. Even in the large wellness area with sauna and several pools, guests are asked to use sauna towels sparingly and sometimes several times. Forgoing daily room cleaning and turn-down service Similarly, as a guest, you can support a hotel’s sustainability efforts by choosing not to have your room cleaned daily. In most cases, you have to explicitly decline. For example, the sustainable Hotel Luise in Erlangen, Germany, tried to switch to opt-in (i.e., you get daily room cleaning only if you want it), but that would have meant being stripped of all their hotel stars by the Hotel Stars Union! However, at the ADLER Lodge RITTEN in South Tyrol (a luxurious all-inclusive resort close to nature), the turndown service has become an opt-in offer. This means that rooms are only prepared in the evening if you, the guest, specifically request it. No slippers The slippers provided in a hotel’s spa area are disposable products that generate huge amounts of waste. According to the German magazine Focus, the Steigenberger Hotels alone (a total of 60 hotels and resorts) would order 180,000 pairs of slippers for their guests each year. One can only imagine the mountain of slipper waste in the entire industry! The HUBERTUS Mountain Refugio Allgäu has therefore removed the slippers from the rooms and will only provide them upon request. Instead, guests are asked to bring their own. The romantic Hotel Das Rübezahl in Füssen, Germany, takes a similar approach to the slipper issue: guests are only provided with hotel slippers for the spa upon request, and the slippers are made of linen and cork, making them compostable. Backpack and shopping bag provided In many vacation destinations, plastic bags are still the norm. Even though a lot of plastic waste could be avoided! That is why CERVO Mountain Resort Zermatt in Switzerland provides guests with both a backpack for hiking and reusable bags for shopping. Digital Guest Magazine Digitization also reduces waste. Guests receive a digital reservation confirmation, there is a digital guest magazine and digital services. At the Eco-Hotel Okelmann’s, for example, you can download Komoot maps created by Senior Okelmann to your phone so you can start cycling right away. The Hotel Klosterbräu in Seefeld, Tyrol, has a guest channel on the hotel TV where you can find out about all the events and offers at the hotel. Offering waste separation for guests As mentioned at the beginning, many people use more disposable items on vacation than at home. Recycling is also often not as successful on vacation. However, this is not always the guests’ fault… You may have experienced the situation where there is only one disposable waste bin in the hotel room and you don’t even have the opportunity to separate your own waste. Some hotels may also think that their international guests don’t know how to it. Not so at Keemala on the island of Phuket in Thailand. “We have clearly marked recycling and waste stations throughout the resort, making it easy for guests to dispose of their waste properly,” they wrote to us. Unlike many internationally managed hotels on the island of Phuket, Keemala is owned by a local family who are very conscious of their impact on the environment. The 5-star ADLER Lodge RITTEN is another example of how in-room waste separation can be done in style. Toilet paper made out of Tetra Pak According to Statista, global per capita consumption of toilet paper reach almost 14 kilograms per person in 2023. However, in Germany, the figure is much higher, at 30.6 kilograms per person. A lot of trees have to be cut down to produce all this fresh fiber. The SCHWARZWALD PANORAMA in Bad Herrenalb has switched to toilet paper made from recycled beverage cartons. This reflects the concept of recycling that the wellness and selfness hotel also applies to its room furnishings. Wooden coffee pods eliminate single-use plastics Coffee capsule machines are definitely not the most sustainable way to make coffee. However, they are a great solution for allowing guests in a hotel suite to make their own coffee. The Birkenhof***** Spa and Genuss Resort uses Rezemo wooden coffee capsules. They contain coffee from sustainable sources. The other amenities of the 5-star wellness hotel are packaged in plastic-free cardboard as well. Zero-Waste Goodbye Gift When you leave, hotels often give you a small parting gift – and that too is a source of packaging waste. Of course, sustainable hotels have also thought about how to give you, the guest, a gift that is both beautiful and environmentally friendly. At the Naturhotel Outside in the Hohe Tauern National Park in East Tyrol, Austria, guests receive a jar of homemade jam in a reusable glass jar. The Hotel Weihrerhof in South Tyrol, on the Italian side of the Alps, offers soaps from its own organic cosmetics line, BergSea, which uses water from the Wolfsgruben Lake, located directly in front of the hotel. “We want our guests to take the soaps home with them and continue to dream of the Weihrerhof,” says the host family. As you can see, Green PearlsⓇ hotels have put a lot of thought into how they can eliminate single-use items, waste and plastic, which means you may use no more single-use items on your vacation than you would at home – in fact, you may use fewer items than at home!"
"Hiking in Germany, Austria and Switzerland","Skis on, out of the hotel and onto the slopes – a ski-in, ski-out hotel lets you start your day’s skiing right outside the hotel door, saving you the daily shuttle ride. But that’s not all that makes your ski vacation sustainable. We’ll show you what else to look for and introduce you to six sustainable accommodations right on the slopes. 5 ways to make your ski vacation more sustainable Skiing vacations have been criticized from a sustainability perspective due to the extensive infrastructure required. That’s why we’d like to start by briefly summarizing how you can minimize your carbon footprint on a ski vacation: Ski-in, ski-out hotels with guaranteed snow In the face of climate change, we recommend preparing to compromise and having a “Plan B” in case there is no snow during your booked trip, such as winter hiking or a cultural program. Alternatively, consider staying at ski hotels located in “snow-sure” areas, typically in the Alpine region above 1,200 meters. Is artificial snow an environmental issue? According to Statista, about 90 percent of all ski slopes in Italy have snowmaking systems. In Austria the figure is 70%, in Switzerland 53% and in Germany only 25%. Attitudes toward artificial snow vary widely across the Alpine region. Ski resorts that use artificial snow, such as Dolomiti Superski, argue that artificial snow is “just water”. When forced out of a small hole under high pressure, the cold turns it into snow. This process does not involve any chemicals. Water typically comes from specially constructed reservoirs and returns to the ground as the snow melts. So there are no problems? According to the WWF, there are. Artificial snow requires millions of gallons of water, energy and noise. The absence of trees on the slopes and the compacted ground from grading prevent the snow from being absorbed quickly when it melts, increasing the risk of landslides. The WWF ultimately demands a halt to the development of new ski resorts. It also criticizes hotel complexes as “real energy eaters”. This makes choosing a sustainable ski hotel all the more important. Sustainable ski-in, ski-out hotels in South Tyrol, Tyrol and Switzerland Here are five ski hotels that are right on the slopes and committed to sustainability. As an added bonus, there’s also a vacation home in Tyrol that’s not right on the slopes – but the ski bus stops right outside. #1 Paradiso Pure.Living Vegan Hotel | South Tyrol | Italy The Paradiso Pure.Living Vegan Hotel is located at an altitude of 2,020 meters on the Seiser Alm in the Dolomites. Due to its proximity to the UNESCO World Heritage Site, the hotel feels a special commitment to nature. It is unique in the region in its commitment to the vegan lifestyle. Food and beverages are 100 percent vegan, and as much as possible is organic and locally sourced. For example, you will find many creations with organic South Tyrolean apples, but also vegan pizza for lunch, vegan brownies in the afternoon, dumplings, pasta, herbs and vegetables – a fantastically creative and climate-friendly plant-based cuisine that you should try, even if you are not vegan! In addition to its magnificent location on two ski slopes, the hotel offers a spa area with several saunas and an outdoor saltwater hot tub. The hotel also promotes contemporary art with rotating exhibitions. Furthermore, it uses green electricity from Alperia, which is 90 percent hydroelectric. Ski Resort: The Paradiso Pure.Living Vegan Hotel is located in the Seiser Alm ski resort with 32 ski runs. However, the Seiser Alm is only one of twelve interconnected ski resorts, all of which are part of the Dolomiti Superski area. This means that with one ski pass you have 1,200 kilometers of slopes at your disposal! (For comparison, 200 kilometers or more of slopes is what you call a “big ski area”). Fortunately, Dolomiti Superski is also committed to sustainability, as detailed here on their website. However, the resort does use artificial snow. According to them, natural snow would not last the entire season, so they have to use artificial one. Sustainable travel: You can reach the Seiser Alm by train. From there the hotel will pick you up with a snow shuttle at a meeting point. #2 Hotel Bella Vista Zermatt | Switzerland Hotel Bella Vista Zermatt is a small, family-run hotel with only 21 rooms. The hotel has a view of the Matterhorn and is located above the center of Zermatt on 1620m. The Anthamatten family has managed the establishment for three generations. Hostess Fabienne Anthamatten is dedicated to zero-waste practices and has a keen interest in old wood and glacier melt. Her husband, Simon, is a mountain guide and helicopter pilot. Fabienne’s sister, Stefanie, a trained yoga teacher, also welcomes guests at the reception. Meanwhile, “Mama” Bernadette delights visitors with her homemade soups and jams. The Swiss hotel is not only family friendly, but also very cozy – with a stone pine parlor and fireplace in the lobby, as well as a small spa area with saunas. Ski area: The hotel is located below the Sunnegga – Rothorn valley station – so the valley run takes you directly to your hotel. Here you are connected to the Rothorn, Gornergrat Glacier and the Matterhorn Paradise ski area, which also includes Zermatt. Matterhorn Paradise is the highest ski area in the Alps (almost 4,000 meters in some places) and the largest summer ski area in Europe. It is open year round as many of the slopes are on glaciers. There are 360 km of slopes and you can even ski to Italy. Zermatt’s cable cars have been investing in sustainability for several years and are TourCert certified. Despite its glacier location, the slopes are regularly covered with artificial snow. Sustainable travel: Zermatt is car-free and accessible by train – as an added bonus, the hotel will even upgrade you to 1st class on the Visp-Zermatt route (for stays of 3 nights or more). Your luggage can be transported separately. A complimentary Hotel Bella Vista shuttle will pick you up at the train station. #3 CERVO Mountain Resort Zermatt | Switzerland The CERVO Mountain Resort, also located in the Swiss ski resort of Zermatt on the Matterhorn, is an exceptional ski-in, ski-out hotel. The sustainable resort consists of several buildings, restaurants and a spa area, and CERVO’s terraces are a popular spot for après-ski. The program includes numerous social events with live music, a group moonlight ski decent, movie night with fondue, etc. So this is the perfect place for you if you want to meet new people and enjoy some entertainment during your ski vacation. Ski area: The resort in Zermatt is also part of the aforementioned Matterhorn Paradise. Sustainable travel: You can also reach CERVO Mountain Resort by train via Zermatt station. Your ski pass can be ordered prior to your arrival and picked up at the reception desk. #4 Biohotel Grafenast | Tirol | Österreich If you are looking for a ski-in-ski-out hotel for a family ski vacation, we recommend the Biohotel Grafenast in Tyrol. The hotel is run by the Unterlechner family. Grandfather “Rodel-Toni” built a toboggan hut on the Pillberg in 1907, which still exists today. Situated at an altitude of 1,330 meters, you have a wonderful view of the valley. With only 23 rooms (some of which are family rooms with separate children’s rooms), the atmosphere is intimate. Organic food, environmental protection and nature are very important to the Unterlechners, which is why they cook only with organic products. Ski area: Biohotel Grafenast is located just 150 meters from the Kellerjoch ski area. The base station of the Kellerjochbahn, which takes you up to 1,890 meters, is just a few steps away. The small ski area has 20 km of slopes and 7 downhill runs, making it perfect for a (first) ski vacation with children. According to Snowtrex, about 30 percent of the slopes are covered with artificial snow. By the way, Café Rodel-Toni is located right next to the children’s ski school. Here parents can take a break while the kids learn to ski or play in the Kinderland. Sustainable travel: The closest train stations are Jenbach and Schwaz. For stays of three nights or more, half the taxi fare to the Biohotel will be reimbursed. #5 My Arbor | Südtirol | Italien If you are traveling without children and prefer the tranquility of an adults-only hotel, My Arbor may be just what you are looking for. Located near Brixen, it is an architectural highlight built on stilts in the middle of a spruce forest. The wellness hotel is located directly on the Plose Mountain. „After breakfast, I go to the ski room, put on my ski boots, grab my skis, and head straight from My Arbor to the Plose base station.“ – Alexandra Huber, My Arbor Ski area: The Plose ski area is particularly sunny and with 7 lifts and about 40 km of slopes ranging in altitude from 1,067 to 2,446 meters, quite modest. Its highlight is South Tyrol’s longest downhill run: 9 km. Sustainable travel: Brixen train station has direct connections from many major cities in Italy, Germany and Austria. Guests staying at My Arbor for 7 nights or more are picked up at the station free of charge. Otherwise, a taxi will cost approximately 30 euros for a 15-minute ride. #6 Summit Lodges Pfunds | Tyrol | Austria Finally, we would like to introduce you to two vacation homes that are not ski-in-ski-out, but have a ski bus stop right outside the door. The Summit Lodges Pfunds are American log cabin-style vacation homes that sleep up to six people and have their own sauna and wood-burning fireplace. With their own kitchens, you will be able to cook for yourself and plan your winter vacation at your own pace. Ski area: There are six ski resorts in the area and the ski bus stops just steps away from the apartments. A 20 minute drive will take you to the Tyrolean ski resort Nauders, which has 75 kilometers of slopes between 1,400 and 2,750 meters. The resort is snow sure, but artificial snow is still in use. If you take the ski bus a little further, you can also reach the Italian region of South Tyrol in about 35 minutes. Here at the Reschen Pass, there are 65 kilometers of slopes and 15 ski lifts around the Reschen Lake. Due to the altitude of 1,500 to 2,400 meters, it is considered snow-sure as well, but snow machines are still employed. Artificial snowmaking will continue to spread As you can see, even resorts that advertise sustainability cannot avoid the use of artificial snow. Particularly alarming is the fact that in the United States, slopes are already snowed with the addition of bacteria, a practice banned in Germany and Austria. The bacteria ensure that snow is produced even at low temperatures. Environmentalists fear that this could have unprecedented effects on the environment. But with global warming, it could be an attractive option for more ski resorts. In the future, a ski-in, ski-out vacation will only be possible through sustainability Skiing is far less sustainable than more gentle winter sports such as snowshoeing. All the more reason to consider some sustainability issues when going on a ski vacation. Ski-in-ski-out hotels are located in the heart of the resort, so you can experience nature – and its preparation – firsthand. As wonderful as this is, it should also be possible for future generations."
Vacation by bike: Ideas for the world bicycle day,"From the cold cut to the cover – at sustainable hotels you can discover great, eco-friendly and fair hotel products that might also be an inspiration for you back home. Do products make an accommodation sustainable? As we see time and again at Green PearlsⓇ accommodations, the paths to greater sustainability are many and varied. It always depends on local conditions and opportunities – as well as the individual priorities of hoteliers. Particularly critical to sustainability in the hotel industry are Things like “honey from your own beehive” are not that important in the overall ecological balance. However, the many small contributions add up, and for the guest, the attention to detail often makes all the difference. 18 environmental and resource friendly products #1 Workwear Many sustainable hotels pay attention to sustainability when it comes to their employees’ workwear. Here are some key points that will make not only your workwear, but also all your everyday clothing, better: 👉Read more on our blog about sustainable hotel workwear. #2 Bathrobe The bathrobe is one of the luxuries a hotel offers. As with any item of clothing, fashions change regularly. In recent years, for example, robes have become more selfie-friendly or come with smartphone-sized pockets. Colorful hooded robes made with GOTS-certified organic cotton are all the rage. But some sustainable hotels have decided not to phase out the classic white robe, because it’s more sustainable to use well-maintained items for as long as possible. 👉Here are the bathrobe trends for 2024/2025. #3 Beds and bedding Hästens beds are not only the most expensive beds in the world, they are also very popular with many of our sustainable hotel partners (e.g. CERVO Mountain Resort Zermatt). These boxsprings are handmade in Sweden and filled with horsehair. Other partners rely on COCO MAT’s vegan beds (e.g. the Lifestylehotel SAND at the Baltic Sea). 👉Learn more about sleeping comfort at eco-hotels and vacation rentals #4 Bread Have you ever enjoyed a bread sommelier’s selection of breads? In our blog, we talked with bread sommelier Benjamin Profanter from the Naturbackstube in Brixen. He supplies the wellness hotel My Arbor* (about 15 minutes from Brixen). Benjamin explains what makes bread sustainable and good. For example, ancient grains are especially important. 👉You can read the blog article about sustainable bread here PS: We have also put together some tips for sustainable snacks when hiking. #5 Decoration At Green PearlsⓇ hotels and accommodations, you will often find ingenious decorating ideas that we have already discussed several times here on the blog. What’s great about them is that they are often DIY projects, natural products or upcycles, and that you can easily recreate many of them at home: #6 Breakfast Have you ever only eaten breakfast at a hotel? Internationally, hotels are often among the best places to have breakfast, surprising you with a nice atmosphere and many delicacies. Sustainable hotels like the SCHWARZWALD PANORAMA in Bad Herrenalb, Germany, offer a completely waste-free breakfast buffet. A hybrid of buffet and table service has also proven to be ecologically sound – egg dishes, for example, are guaranteed fresh and nothing needs to be thrown away. 👉Learn more about breakfast at sustainable hotels By the way: Have you ever made your own hummus? This vegan power breakfast from the Levant is easy to make, as the Paradiso Pure.Living Vegan Hotel* on the Seiser Alm in South Tyrol shows. #7 Honey Many sustainable hotels have made a commitment to protect the bees and care for hives. The sweet reward is the honey that many of them produce. The APIPURA hotel rinner* on the Ritten in South Tyrol is at the forefront. The hotel is run by passionate beekeeper Paul Rinner and his family. In addition to the hotel’s own organic honey, the hotel also offers Api-Wellness, where guests can inhale the air from the beehive. The hotel has been around for 50 years and has been committed to biodiversity and bee conservation since before the bee hype. 👉Learn more about the power of honey. #8 Coffee We spoke to Viennese barista Moritz Unterlechner of the Unterlechner family, who run the Biohotel Grafenast in Vienna, about the sustainable coffee trends for 2024/2025. He recommends the organic coffee beans (espresso and filter coffee) from BOB & Co. The German Green City Hotel Vauban in Freiburg is an integration company and therefore works with other integration companies whenever possible, such as the coffee roaster Zollernalb.. 👉Discover sustainable coffee trends here #9 Clothes Hanger The SCHWARZWALD PANORAMA is increasingly designing the interior of the hotel with a closed cycle of raw materials in mind, and has now renovated an entire floor according to the cradle-to-cradleⓇ principle. It is important that all materials are either biodegradable or 100% recyclable. 👉In this Insight, they present their hangers made of meadow grass. #10 Lamp Shades Other cool things can be made from grass, hay and hay flowers. The Hotel Klosterbräu, for example, uses bedside lamps made of hay flowers in its nature rooms. The nature rooms are made entirely from natural and local materials – the wood comes from the hotel’s own forest and the walls are plastered with local clay. 👉Learn more about hayflower lampshades here. #11 Marmalades and jams Do you know the difference between jam, marmalade, jelly and fruit spread? Well, this summer we explained it on our blog and also featured delicious sweet spreads from our Green Pearls partners – with recipes, of course. Homemade jam from local fruits is not only delicious, but also a zero waste product! 👉Read about jams, jellies and marmalades here. #12 Natural Cosmetics In sustainable accommodations, you shouldn’t find disposable products in the bathroom. The small bottles and tubes that are still available in many conventional hotels not only create a lot of waste, they often contain hazardous substances and microplastics. Some hotels, like the ADLER Lodge RITTEN*, even make their own line of cosmetics, with ingrediance right from the region. That way they know exactly what is in it. Learn more in our article about natural cosmetics in hotels. For background information, we also recommend the article how beauty care and environment are related. 👉The Green DIY Spa Day article even includes recipes you can try at home. #13 Olives Olives grow throughout the Mediterranean, and for many of our southern partners, the olive harvest is an annual highlight. Relais del Maro in Liguria*, for example, hosts an olive festival every November in the coastal town of Imperia. At the festival, you can taste a wide variety of olives. Of course, the region’s famous Taggiasca olives are also available at the Albergo Diffuso, a 4-star hotel spread over several buildings in the village for a truly authentic Italian experience. 👉Read more about olives in Italy and Spain. #14 Plant-based drink Cow’s milk has a high carbon footprint due to the way cows are raised. But are vegan milk alternatives really greener? Hotels such as the 100% vegan, adults-only LA VIMEA* in South Tyrol have long offered guests a wide range of plant-based drinks for their coffee. Now, a “cappuccino with oat drink” is a staple on the menus of other hotels as well. 👉Find out if this is better for the environment with our sustainability check for plant-based beverages. #15 Carpets “Even though our carpets are trampled on, we still pay a lot of attention to sustainability, design and the concept behind them when making our selections”. This is how the Hotel Luise in Erlangen, Germany, describes its policy. The hotel uses carpet tiles from Interface (locations in Germany, Austria and Switzerland). Interface focuses on circular carpets made from recycled materials. The “NetEffect” carpet tiles, for example, are made from recycled fishing nets. According to various studies, abandoned or lost fishing nets make up the largest proportion of marine plastic. The Lifestylehotel SAND in Timmendorfer Strand also has Interface carpet tiles. The adults-only hotel chose a model made of post- and pre-consumer PET to match the hotel’s natural Baltic Sea style. 👉Learn more about carpets made from fishing nets #16 STUA Furniture Sustainable furniture is also a hallmark of green accommodations. Many Green PearlsⓇ hotels feature restored antiques or furniture made by a local carpenter using local wood. The OCEANO Health Spa Hotel in Tenerife recommends the Spanish furniture brand STUA, which is also available in stores. 👉Learn more about STUA furniture. #17 Tea Strictly speaking, only the leaves of the tea plant are tea – but in German-speaking countries, other infusions made from herbs, spices and flowers are also called “tea”. You can easily brew these in a carbon-neutral way using the plants on your balcony! 👉Learn more in our blog article about tea, where we also reveal the blends of some of the hotels. #18 Vases Every hotel lobby should have at least one beautiful vase of fresh flowers. But to be sustainable, you need two things: first, a sustainable vase (at the Klosterhof – Alpine Hideaway & Spa in Bayerisch Gmain, these are made by a local artist who uses a 3D printer to create vases out of coffee grounds). And second, sustainable flowers. STURM in Mellrichstadt introduced us to the Slow Flower movement. 👉Hier siehst du die Vasen aus Kaffeesatz “I saw this in a Green PearlsⓇ hotel” By the way, the reason I find sustainable hotel products so cool is that they are so beautiful to show off 🙂 They combine your travels with individuality, with the skills of professional interior designers and of course with a love for our planet. So the products listed here won’t be the last you’ll find on the blog. Do you already have an idea of what we should include? *CIN-Codes: IT021072A1QCJQTLUQ (ADLER Lodge Ritten) IT021011A1AE4737IT (My Arbor) IT008010A1NIWKHTTF (Relais del Maro) IT021072A1UOWUIDH4 (APIPURA hotel rinner) IT021056A1J4HHYSU4 (LA VIMEA) IT021019A16MFGOUCR (Paradiso Pure.Living Vegan Hotel) Save this article to Pinterest."
Green Wedding: special places for a special day,"Sound massage with Tibetan singing bowls is a wellness trend that is becoming increasingly popular in sustainable hotels that cater to mindful guests. You can find it in Green PearlsⓇ hotels around the world, including Nepal, Cambodia, Thailand, Italy, and Germany. Some offer it as part of their weekly program, others offer it as a spa treatment, and some even organize entire sound massage retreats. Here you can find out where you can add a sound massage to your next trip – and the benefits it can bring you. Peace and relaxation through singing bowls “The massages bring about a state of absolute relaxation that is unique. Even highly stressed people find peace within a short time.” That is how Maren Geisler-Okelmann of the Yoga-Hotel Okelmann’s in Warpe describes the effect of the singing bowls. The hostess is a trained yoga teacher and conducts sound therapy according to Peter HessⓇ in her courses and retreats. The Peter HessⓇ Institute is only 7 km from Warpe! Singing bowl massage according to Peter HessⓇ The singing bowl massage, which is a wellness trend in many places today, was developed by Peter Hess about 30 years ago. The German engineer for physical technology came into contact with singing bowls during his travels in Nepal. According to the institute’s website, he “succeeded in adapting ancient Far Eastern knowledge from the Himalayas about sound and rhythm and their healing effects on body, mind, and soul to the needs of people in Western societies.” It is not entirely clear how singing bowls were originally used. Some researchers even suggest that they were simply used as cooking utensils and that the tradition was “invented” later on. Others suggest that singing bowls once played an important role in Buddhism – but that the tradition has been lost. The Peter HessⓇ Institute (PHI) now has 16 academies in 14 countries and claims to have trained approximately 10,000 people in the Peter Hess Sound Massage Method (protected in Europe). How does a singing bowl massage work? During a Peter HessⓇ singing bowl massage, several singing bowls are placed on the (clothed) body and sounded. The bowls, which are cast in brass or bronze, produce a gong-like sound with fine vibrations. These vibrations are transmitted to the body and are said to “release blockages” and lead to relaxation. Both physical (muscle relaxation) and mental. A singing bowl massage usually lasts between 30 and 90 minutes. “Circling thoughts come to rest,” reports Maren vom Okelmann’s. One enters a “pleasant state in which one can let go.” The vibrations emanating from the singing bowls spread through the skin, tissues, bones, organs, and fluids of the body, creating a “gentle, internal massage.” “Experiencing sound is a wonderful and healing thing.” – Maren Geisler-Okelmann 👉Here you can book a sound massage at Okelmann’s. Difference between singing bowl massage and a sound bath In some wellness and yoga hotels, you can have a sound bath in addition to a singing bowl massage. The difference is: For a singing bowl massage, the bowls are placed on the body, while for a sound bath, the bowls are placed in the room. A sound bath is especially suitable for groups. The vibrations of the gong are transferred from the bowl to the body. At the Biohotel Grafenast in Tyrol, a sound bath in small groups is part of the weekly program, and you can also book a “singing bowl massage with Sabine” at any time. 60 minutes cost 85 Euro and 90 minutes 120 Euro. At Biohotel Grafenast you can experience a great combination of a Tyrolean nature vacation with an Alpine panorama and Far Eastern relaxation methods. The family-run hotel and its surroundings have been designed according to Feng Shui as a place of power, and yoga and Qigong classes are also available. As part of its in-house treatments, the HUBERTUS Mountain Refugio Allgäu offers both a sound bath and a sound massage. The cost for a 50-minute sound bath is 120 euros alone and 180 euros with another person. The sustainable hotel in Balderschwang practices an “Ayurvedic lifestyle” – both in the wellness area and in the culinary arts. The sounds and vibrations of the singing bowls are considered to be energy that “can set every single cell in the body vibrating.” This is believed to have a healing effect. 👉For more information, visit HUBERTUS Ayurveda. Sound baths in the Italian ADLER Spa Resorts & Lodges weekly program The sustainable and luxurious ADLER Spa Resorts & Lodges in Italy also believe in the benefits of sound baths and have made them an integral part of their wellness programs. “At ADLER Spa Resort SICILIA, we offer the ‘Gong Sound’ experience every Wednesday, Friday, and Saturday,” the team explains. “This treatment uses the slow, rhythmic beats of the gong, punctuated by brief moments of silence.” At the ADLER Lodge Ritten* the Klangbad takes place every Wednesday and Saturday. The location on the Ritten plateau in South Tyrol is ideal for combining an active vacation in nature with wellness. “You may find yourself taking a short but sweet nap during the sound treatments. The gentle sounds promote such a deep relaxation that a relaxed sleep is simply part of the experience, making it even more intense.” – ADLER Lodge RITTEN Sound bath as an included service The German hotel Das Rübezahl in the Allgäu region, like ADLER Spa Resorts & Lodges, offers sound baths as an included weekly program. In addition to the sound massage sessions, yoga and Qigong are also offered. Meditation with singing bowls Some Green PearlsⓇ hotels combine singing bowls with meditation. For example, the spa at CERVO Mountain Resort Zermatt in Switzerland offers a “singing bowl meditation” as part of its weekly yoga and meditation program. The sound bath helps calm the mind and release tension in the body. Guests leave feeling “more balanced and serene.” My Arbor* near Brixen in South Tyrol offers both singing bowl massage and singing bowl meditation. “It is a special form of relaxation that many of our guests love. They report feeling a deep sense of calm and lightness during the singing bowl treatment.” – Hotel My Arbor What is the difference between a singing bowl massage and a singing bowl meditation? The Keemala Resort on the island of Phuket in Thailand has answered this question. According to the resort, singing bowl massage is more about relaxing the muscles and stimulating circulation, while singing bowl meditation focuses on the mind. The goal of meditation is to achieve “mental clarity” through sounds and vibrations. Sound Healing Retreats If you want to delve deeper into the world of singing bowl healing, there are also a few retreats available. The Hotel Klosterhof – Alpine Hideaway & Spa hosted its first “Sound Healing Retreat” with Lisa Schuster, a physician and sound therapist from Munich. The three-night retreat included various sound baths, singing bowl massage, singing bowl meditation, toning exercises, yoga, and a cocoa ceremony. At the Gut Sonnenhausen near Munich, Germany, singing bowls and cocoa ceremonies were also combined during the “Finding Peace Day Retreat” held in the fall of 2024. The retreat was led by Thails de la Paz, who works regularly with the Sonnenhausen Estate. Sustainable wellness hotels with a Far Eastern touch Yoga, mindfulness, TCM, Ayurveda, singing bowls – much of the modern Western lifestyle has its origins in East Asia. In addition to the Okelmann’s, Grafenast, and HUBERTUS Mountain Refugio hotels already mentioned, the Green PearlsⓇ hotels, which are sustainably and individually managed, include many others inspired by Far Eastern culture. Stephan Bode, owner of the SCHWARZWALD PANORAMA in Bad Herrenalb, Germany, draws his personal strength from the words of Buddha and has integrated a Selfness Center into the hotel. Here, guests are offered mindfulness training, resilience, forest bathing, and fasting cures. Singing bowl massages are an optional extra. Heiner Buckermann designed the entire Lifestyle Resort Zum Kurfürsten in Bernkastel-Kues on the Mosel River according to Feng Shui (with the help of a Chinese master). He also integrated a TCM center into the hotel. He places great importance on the 5 elements and wants the life energy Qi to flow freely throughout the hotel. Among the treatments available at the TCM Center is a singing bowl massage based on the 5 elements. “Based on the five elements of traditional Chinese medicine, the goal is to achieve a healing balance of the organs, which stimulates the organism to regenerate itself. By placing and striking the body with singing bowls of different sizes, (…) qi, blood and emotions can flow freely again.” – Lifestyle Resort Zum Kurfürsten A 30-minute sound massage costs 47 euros. Singing bowl massage in Nepal The Himalayan region of Nepal is where Peter Hess was introduced to singing bowls and where the trend that is sweeping the West began. At the Pavilions Himalayas – The Farm you can experience the original Nepalese version of the singing bowl treatment. The sustainably managed resort is known for its yoga classes with Yogi Shyam Gurung, who we featured in our Yoga for pros blog post. His retreats are not only about physical exercises but also about a theoretical, traditional understanding of yoga. Sound bowls are used here in conjunction with meditation, Reiki, self-healing, and Ayurvedic treatments. “We offer yoga, meditation, and sound bowl sessions either as individual sessions or in small groups that know each other well,” the resort says. Singing bowl massage in Cambodia In Cambodia, you can receive a singing bowl massage at the Farmhouse Smiling Gecko. Buddhism is the state religion and singing bowls have a long tradition in Buddhism. It is said that singing bowls existed at the time of the historical Buddha. However, little is known about their exact origin and original meaning. At the luxurious Farmhouse Smiling Gecko Resort, you can experience the country authentically while supporting the Smiling Gecko Project. It supports the local population through training centers, a school, organic farming, and fair employment. Sound bowl meditation and science Finally, it is important to note that the effectiveness of a singing bowl massage is not scientifically proven and falls within the realm of alternative medicine. However, you may find that sometimes a beautiful sound is more pleasant than a long speech 🙂 *CIN: IT021072A1QCJQTLUQ (ADLER Lodge Ritten) *CIN: IT021011A1AE4737IT (My Arbor) Save this blog article on Pinterest"
The 5 most beautiful eco-luxury hotels in the Alps,"Want to be sustainable on vacation and be a model (sustainable) hotel guest? Then read on to find out what hoteliers are saying about what their valued guests should NOT do while on vacation 🙂 Support, not undermine, the efforts of sustainable hotels and accommodation When it comes to the do’s and don’ts of travel, this article looks at it from a sustainability perspective. In other articles of this kind, for example, one of the first rules is often: “Don’t dress like a tourist!” Trekking sandals and necklaces (as you probably know) are not considered fashionable – but from an ecological point of view, we don’t see a problem here! However, too much revealing clothing on vacation can offend the religious and cultural sensitivities of local people, as Indonesian Lucienne Anhar explains in our Bali blog post. On this blog, we feature privately and individually owned hotels and vacation rentals that demonstrate sustainable and environmentally friendly practices in all areas. You will often see small signs reminding you that you can do without fresh towels every day (a simple measure that contributes significantly to the conservation of energy, fresh water, and detergents in the tourism industry). But sometimes, as guests, we may not even be aware that our behavior is undermining the resort’s sustainability efforts in one way or another. So it’s time to ask our hotelier partners what we might want to avoid doing. Don’ts for a sustainable vacation at a hotel #1 Use your own shampoo At The Pavilions Himalayas – The Farm (just named one of the 22 “Absolute Best Hotels in Asia” by Fodor’s Travel), guests are not encouraged to use their own shampoo and shower gel. The simple reason is that the Nepalese resort is run according to ecological criteria and is surrounded by organic farmland. The water cycles of the farm, the kitchen, and the resort are all connected. Chemicals, pollutants, and microplastics, which are often found in many conventional shower products, can harm the farm, the hotel team explains. “We encourage our guests to use the bathroom products we provide because they are all natural and chemical free.” – The Pavilions Himalayas – The Farm #2 Balloons at hotel parties Have you ever considered that balloons are not environmentally friendly decorations or gifts? For this reason, they are not allowed on Gut Sonnenhausen in Glonn (near Munich). “We do a lot of weddings and one thing we don’t do is balloons. Since we are in the middle of a nature reserve, too many balloons and strings end up in the trees or on the ground, where they are nibbled by animals. But this is well accepted by our guests.” – Gut Sonnenhausen #3 Bringing snacks and food to the resort Don’t bring your own snacks, drinks, and take-out food to the resort – you might think, sure, they want to make money. But as Farmhouse Smiling Gecko in Cambodia tells us, they are particularly concerned about the packaging waste. The food that is brought in is usually wrapped in plastic, which ends up as garbage at the resort. And by the way, it’s not a bad thing to support the farmhouse and its Smiling Gecko project. It runs an organic farm, a school, and training centers for employees (or their children) and the local population on its premises. #4 Take bread from the breakfast buffet – yes or no? Should you take bread from the breakfast buffet to make a sandwich for lunch? Our Green PearlsⓇ partners have very different answers to this question, depending on the region in which the hotel is located. At the HUBERTUS Mountain Refugio Allgäu in Balderschwang, for example, the breakfast buffet offers extra “Jausesackerl”, which you can take with you for a snack on the mountain. At the Naturhotel Outside in East Tyrol, however, this is not welcomed. The hiking hotel is located in the middle of the Hohe Tauern Alpine National Park and believes it is important to support the local huts. For them, this is an aspect of economic and social sustainability. “We want our guests to stop and eat at the huts. That’s why we only offer a snack in the afternoon and don’t make snack packs to give away for hikes or anything like that.” – Naturhotel Outside #5 Smoking in Paris In Paris, people smoke a lot more than in other European cities. Every year, the city disposes of about 350 tons (!) of cigarette butts! The Green Spirit Hotels (Hotel Le Pavilions, Amelie and Malar, all in the lively 7th arrondissement, within walking distance of the Seine and the Eiffel Tower) are not happy about this. The small, independent hotels use special air filters to ensure fresh air, and smoking is only allowed in the green courtyard. Sometimes guests stub out their cigarettes in the flower pots! “Even though there are plenty of ashtrays outside!” In case you didn’t know, a cigarette butt is made of plastic and toxins, and especially when watering your plants, the toxins get into the plants, which is why you really shouldn’t do it! Neither in the garden nor outside (because the same thing happens there, only on a larger scale)! The correct place to dispose of them is the garbage. #6 Stealing hotel equipment as a “souvenir” – Please do not do this on vacation Do we really have to say that? Unfortunately, yes. Just on my last vacation (in a nature wagon in the Eifel) we asked the operator if we could have cutlery. “There is cutlery,” he was sure. But apparently, the previous tenants had taken it home… In 2023, the hotel portal Wellness Heaven conducted a survey of around 1,400 European hoteliers, which showed that towels and bathrobes are the most frequently taken items, especially in 5-star hotels. The AC Hotels by Marriott chain reported that approximately 1,250 towels per hotel (!) are stolen each year in a total of 64 hotels. Our partner, the aparthotel OLM Nature Escape in South Tyrol, only opened a year ago and is currently considering how to deal with this problem. “We place more trust in our valued guests than usual; we use valuable items and amenities. For example, a high quality sauna towel in the ApartSuite, high quality kitchen utensils, glasses, porcelain… Some guests take advantage of this and steal from us. They do not appreciate the generosity.” – OLM Nature Escape As you can see, the many little “oh, it won’t be noticed” actions of individual guests add up to a lot of damage, and are therefore clearly antisocial, unsustainable behavior, and things you shouldn’t do on vacation. (And you’re not legally allowed to do them either.) #7 Wasting energy At home, people conserve electricity because it costs money, and in hotels – it’s free. People who think like that don’t think very deeply. You would think that people who book sustainable hotels would have a certain sensitivity when it comes to conserving resources. Unfortunately, that is not necessarily the case. The Naturresort Gerbehof on Lake Constance is surprised by guests who “take showers several times a day, want their towels changed daily, or use a large number of towels in the sauna”. Hotel Bella Vista Zermatt in Switzerland also had guests who wanted their sheets changed “every day. Also sad is when guests “take too much food and then leave everything on the table”. Here are a few more tips for saving energy – at the hotel, too: #8 Trash “Waste is a big problem in general,” says Marco Spiess of Summit Lodges in Pfunds. Guests at the vacation homes in Pfunds, Tyrol, cook for themselves and bring their own food. The host notes: “In some cases, huge amounts of unopened food are thrown away, even though it is still fresh. He tries to point this out to his guests, but it often falls on “deaf ears”. The luxurious Keemala Resort in Thailand has a zero-waste policy and there are no plastic bottles, straws, or the like throughout the resort. Therefore, it is annoying when people bring plastic products from outside. It would also be desirable for guests to recycle their waste properly. There are signs of improvement The Lifestylehotel SAND in Timmendorfer Strand on the Baltic Sea has a positive story to tell about “guest education”. They started early to communicate their “sustainable lifestyle” both internally and to their guests. “It is important not to formulate prohibitions, but to ask for help.” – Marion Muller, Lifestlyhotel SAND She considers it a success that the demand for to-go cups, for example, has become an “exception”. The Biohotel Grafenast in Tyrol is also proud to report that it is very satisfied with the ecological awareness of its guests: „Most of our guests are very conscious of sustainability and live sustainably.“ – Biohotel Grafenast In general, you should continue to do the sustainable things you do at home while you are on vacation. Even though some sustainable practices may not be as common in the country where you are vacationing. “Going wild” on vacation is not trendy at the moment. And it never really has been. Do you have other experiences, examples, or tips for vacation dos and don’ts? Write them down in the comments!"
Green Wedding: special places for a special day,"Sound massage with Tibetan singing bowls is a wellness trend that is becoming increasingly popular in sustainable hotels that cater to mindful guests. You can find it in Green PearlsⓇ hotels around the world, including Nepal, Cambodia, Thailand, Italy, and Germany. Some offer it as part of their weekly program, others offer it as a spa treatment, and some even organize entire sound massage retreats. Here you can find out where you can add a sound massage to your next trip – and the benefits it can bring you. Peace and relaxation through singing bowls “The massages bring about a state of absolute relaxation that is unique. Even highly stressed people find peace within a short time.” That is how Maren Geisler-Okelmann of the Yoga-Hotel Okelmann’s in Warpe describes the effect of the singing bowls. The hostess is a trained yoga teacher and conducts sound therapy according to Peter HessⓇ in her courses and retreats. The Peter HessⓇ Institute is only 7 km from Warpe! Singing bowl massage according to Peter HessⓇ The singing bowl massage, which is a wellness trend in many places today, was developed by Peter Hess about 30 years ago. The German engineer for physical technology came into contact with singing bowls during his travels in Nepal. According to the institute’s website, he “succeeded in adapting ancient Far Eastern knowledge from the Himalayas about sound and rhythm and their healing effects on body, mind, and soul to the needs of people in Western societies.” It is not entirely clear how singing bowls were originally used. Some researchers even suggest that they were simply used as cooking utensils and that the tradition was “invented” later on. Others suggest that singing bowls once played an important role in Buddhism – but that the tradition has been lost. The Peter HessⓇ Institute (PHI) now has 16 academies in 14 countries and claims to have trained approximately 10,000 people in the Peter Hess Sound Massage Method (protected in Europe). How does a singing bowl massage work? During a Peter HessⓇ singing bowl massage, several singing bowls are placed on the (clothed) body and sounded. The bowls, which are cast in brass or bronze, produce a gong-like sound with fine vibrations. These vibrations are transmitted to the body and are said to “release blockages” and lead to relaxation. Both physical (muscle relaxation) and mental. A singing bowl massage usually lasts between 30 and 90 minutes. “Circling thoughts come to rest,” reports Maren vom Okelmann’s. One enters a “pleasant state in which one can let go.” The vibrations emanating from the singing bowls spread through the skin, tissues, bones, organs, and fluids of the body, creating a “gentle, internal massage.” “Experiencing sound is a wonderful and healing thing.” – Maren Geisler-Okelmann 👉Here you can book a sound massage at Okelmann’s. Difference between singing bowl massage and a sound bath In some wellness and yoga hotels, you can have a sound bath in addition to a singing bowl massage. The difference is: For a singing bowl massage, the bowls are placed on the body, while for a sound bath, the bowls are placed in the room. A sound bath is especially suitable for groups. The vibrations of the gong are transferred from the bowl to the body. At the Biohotel Grafenast in Tyrol, a sound bath in small groups is part of the weekly program, and you can also book a “singing bowl massage with Sabine” at any time. 60 minutes cost 85 Euro and 90 minutes 120 Euro. At Biohotel Grafenast you can experience a great combination of a Tyrolean nature vacation with an Alpine panorama and Far Eastern relaxation methods. The family-run hotel and its surroundings have been designed according to Feng Shui as a place of power, and yoga and Qigong classes are also available. As part of its in-house treatments, the HUBERTUS Mountain Refugio Allgäu offers both a sound bath and a sound massage. The cost for a 50-minute sound bath is 120 euros alone and 180 euros with another person. The sustainable hotel in Balderschwang practices an “Ayurvedic lifestyle” – both in the wellness area and in the culinary arts. The sounds and vibrations of the singing bowls are considered to be energy that “can set every single cell in the body vibrating.” This is believed to have a healing effect. 👉For more information, visit HUBERTUS Ayurveda. Sound baths in the Italian ADLER Spa Resorts & Lodges weekly program The sustainable and luxurious ADLER Spa Resorts & Lodges in Italy also believe in the benefits of sound baths and have made them an integral part of their wellness programs. “At ADLER Spa Resort SICILIA, we offer the ‘Gong Sound’ experience every Wednesday, Friday, and Saturday,” the team explains. “This treatment uses the slow, rhythmic beats of the gong, punctuated by brief moments of silence.” At the ADLER Lodge Ritten* the Klangbad takes place every Wednesday and Saturday. The location on the Ritten plateau in South Tyrol is ideal for combining an active vacation in nature with wellness. “You may find yourself taking a short but sweet nap during the sound treatments. The gentle sounds promote such a deep relaxation that a relaxed sleep is simply part of the experience, making it even more intense.” – ADLER Lodge RITTEN Sound bath as an included service The German hotel Das Rübezahl in the Allgäu region, like ADLER Spa Resorts & Lodges, offers sound baths as an included weekly program. In addition to the sound massage sessions, yoga and Qigong are also offered. Meditation with singing bowls Some Green PearlsⓇ hotels combine singing bowls with meditation. For example, the spa at CERVO Mountain Resort Zermatt in Switzerland offers a “singing bowl meditation” as part of its weekly yoga and meditation program. The sound bath helps calm the mind and release tension in the body. Guests leave feeling “more balanced and serene.” My Arbor* near Brixen in South Tyrol offers both singing bowl massage and singing bowl meditation. “It is a special form of relaxation that many of our guests love. They report feeling a deep sense of calm and lightness during the singing bowl treatment.” – Hotel My Arbor What is the difference between a singing bowl massage and a singing bowl meditation? The Keemala Resort on the island of Phuket in Thailand has answered this question. According to the resort, singing bowl massage is more about relaxing the muscles and stimulating circulation, while singing bowl meditation focuses on the mind. The goal of meditation is to achieve “mental clarity” through sounds and vibrations. Sound Healing Retreats If you want to delve deeper into the world of singing bowl healing, there are also a few retreats available. The Hotel Klosterhof – Alpine Hideaway & Spa hosted its first “Sound Healing Retreat” with Lisa Schuster, a physician and sound therapist from Munich. The three-night retreat included various sound baths, singing bowl massage, singing bowl meditation, toning exercises, yoga, and a cocoa ceremony. At the Gut Sonnenhausen near Munich, Germany, singing bowls and cocoa ceremonies were also combined during the “Finding Peace Day Retreat” held in the fall of 2024. The retreat was led by Thails de la Paz, who works regularly with the Sonnenhausen Estate. Sustainable wellness hotels with a Far Eastern touch Yoga, mindfulness, TCM, Ayurveda, singing bowls – much of the modern Western lifestyle has its origins in East Asia. In addition to the Okelmann’s, Grafenast, and HUBERTUS Mountain Refugio hotels already mentioned, the Green PearlsⓇ hotels, which are sustainably and individually managed, include many others inspired by Far Eastern culture. Stephan Bode, owner of the SCHWARZWALD PANORAMA in Bad Herrenalb, Germany, draws his personal strength from the words of Buddha and has integrated a Selfness Center into the hotel. Here, guests are offered mindfulness training, resilience, forest bathing, and fasting cures. Singing bowl massages are an optional extra. Heiner Buckermann designed the entire Lifestyle Resort Zum Kurfürsten in Bernkastel-Kues on the Mosel River according to Feng Shui (with the help of a Chinese master). He also integrated a TCM center into the hotel. He places great importance on the 5 elements and wants the life energy Qi to flow freely throughout the hotel. Among the treatments available at the TCM Center is a singing bowl massage based on the 5 elements. “Based on the five elements of traditional Chinese medicine, the goal is to achieve a healing balance of the organs, which stimulates the organism to regenerate itself. By placing and striking the body with singing bowls of different sizes, (…) qi, blood and emotions can flow freely again.” – Lifestyle Resort Zum Kurfürsten A 30-minute sound massage costs 47 euros. Singing bowl massage in Nepal The Himalayan region of Nepal is where Peter Hess was introduced to singing bowls and where the trend that is sweeping the West began. At the Pavilions Himalayas – The Farm you can experience the original Nepalese version of the singing bowl treatment. The sustainably managed resort is known for its yoga classes with Yogi Shyam Gurung, who we featured in our Yoga for pros blog post. His retreats are not only about physical exercises but also about a theoretical, traditional understanding of yoga. Sound bowls are used here in conjunction with meditation, Reiki, self-healing, and Ayurvedic treatments. “We offer yoga, meditation, and sound bowl sessions either as individual sessions or in small groups that know each other well,” the resort says. Singing bowl massage in Cambodia In Cambodia, you can receive a singing bowl massage at the Farmhouse Smiling Gecko. Buddhism is the state religion and singing bowls have a long tradition in Buddhism. It is said that singing bowls existed at the time of the historical Buddha. However, little is known about their exact origin and original meaning. At the luxurious Farmhouse Smiling Gecko Resort, you can experience the country authentically while supporting the Smiling Gecko Project. It supports the local population through training centers, a school, organic farming, and fair employment. Sound bowl meditation and science Finally, it is important to note that the effectiveness of a singing bowl massage is not scientifically proven and falls within the realm of alternative medicine. However, you may find that sometimes a beautiful sound is more pleasant than a long speech 🙂 *CIN: IT021072A1QCJQTLUQ (ADLER Lodge Ritten) *CIN: IT021011A1AE4737IT (My Arbor) Save this blog article on Pinterest"
Green Wedding: special places for a special day,"While the term “sustainable” may not be a word that (young) children can relate to, the content of the term is quite conceivable. Children are usually very open to things like environmental protection, waste reduction, animal welfare, and justice. On vacation, you have the time to explore these issues with your children in a very practical way. We asked the sustainable accommodations at Green PearlsⓇ what special tips they have for vacations with children. Tipp #1: Vacation without your phone The OLM Nature Escape in South Tyrol recommends: “Try to spend time together without cell phones!” This applies to children and parents alike! The eco-aparthotel offers the “ApartSuite XL” with a kitchenette, two bedrooms, and a children’s bunk bed, where you can spend a great family vacation in nature with up to six people. Fritz Karl, an Austrian theater actor and father of seven, tested a three-week cell phone-free vacation with his children this year. In the TV show Riverboat (see ARD-Mediathek from minute 00:02:00) he says: “At the beginning, it was very exhausting for everyone. But it was worth it! “Yes, but what did you do then?” he is asked incredulously. “Board games!” is his answer. Tipp #2: Board and card games This brings us to the next tip from Elena Scalambrin at the Relais del Maro in Liguria: board games. You don’t even have to bring them on vacation at the Relais del Maro because Elena will be happy to provide you and your children with a variety of games. Of course, you should still bring your family’s favorite game. There are also smaller travel or pocket versions of many classic and popular games! Elena and her family have built an Albergo Diffuso in the picturesque village of Borgomaro. This means that the 4-star hotel is spread over several buildings in the village and you will be staying right next to the villagers. You are sure to see some Italian kids playing soccer in the street, and maybe your kids can join in 🙂 Great board games with kids (5 to 13 years old) I also enjoy playing games with my kids. For newer games that you can easily take on vacation, I recommend these: And for classic games, of course, we love UNO, Chess, Mau-Mau, and Yatzy. If you have room for a whole box of games, Crazy Labyrinth and Labyrinth of the Masters are also great, as well as Nobody’s Perfect (you have to be able to write here). Tipp #3: Introduce children to nature A family vacation is a wonderful opportunity to get close to nature. For example, a vacation in Tirol, Austria. In Pfunds, you will find an “untouched” mountain world with meadows, wild water, and a traditional village. For a family vacation, we recommend the Summit Lodges. These are two log cabins, each about 120 square meters, for up to 6 people, with their own sauna and fireplace. Children can play safely in the surrounding garden and explore nature while parents relax on the terrace. Peter Unterlechner of Biohotel Grafenast in Tyrol, Austria, has also set up family rooms and even offers a special children’s program during the holiday season. He has a few suggestions on how to introduce your children to nature: Tipp #4: Rent an e-bike with a child trailer Hotel Bella Vista is located in car-free Zermatt, so the best way to explore the area around the Matterhorn is on foot or by bike. Fabienne Anthamatten, a member of the host family, recommends that families with children rent a Chariot e-bike in the village. „That way, the family can get to great picnic spots and everyone is happy.” – Hotel Bella Vista Zermatt Tipp #5: Adventure travel by train As you probably know, getting to and from your vacation destination is often your biggest environmental impact. The next biggest impact is where you stay. At Hotel Klosterbräu in Seefeld, Tyrol, you can do both (as long as you live in Europe) and combine a sustainable hotel with a climate-friendly trip. “Since Seefeld has a train station right in the center of town, it makes sense to travel by train. Children see it as an adventure and the trip is fun. Sustainable travel with children is an opportunity to teach them values at an early age and to raise their awareness of environmental protection.” – Hotel Klosterbräu The hotel is family-run (the seventh generation is currently growing up) and there are great activities for all ages, including a small petting zoo! While the kids take a guided tour, make pizza, or play pool during the holiday program, parents can relax by the pool or take an extended hike. Tipp #6: Learn interesting things Learning is not boring (just don’t say “We are learning now”). At APIPURA hotel rinner, for example, you can learn a lot about bees and organic farming. The father/grandfather of the host family Rinner is a passionate beekeeper and likes to take his guests to the beehives. There is also a bee nature trail on the property. Of course, the hotel’s own organic honey is available at the breakfast buffet, and as a special feature, you can enjoy api-welness and inhale the air from the beehive. A highlight for a vacation with children at the APIPURA hotel rinner is certainly the Ritten-Card, which you can get for free here. With this card, you can use all public transportation (including the cable car and the Ritten train, which stops right next to the hotel) for free. It also gives you free entry to many museums. Tipp #7: Introduce children to the culture of the destination The luxury eco-resort Keemala in Phuket, Thailand, sent us a number of suggestions on how to make a vacation with children more sustainable. They feel it is very important to always involve the children and give them lots of explanations – for example, separating waste together and explaining the problem of plastic pollution to children. A vacation in a foreign country (such as Thailand) can be used to discover the flora, fauna, and culture of the country together with the children. Conclusion Sustainability is a lifestyle that can be practiced in all areas of life, including on vacation. The best way to reach your children is to set an example by implementing sustainable practices with them. This can be done easily and authentically at sustainable hotels and vacation rentals. And who knows – maybe they’ll be even more “strict” than you are – it’s been known to happen 🙂"
The 5 most beautiful eco-luxury hotels in the Alps,"Did you know that some of our Green PearlsⓇ hotels are designated Sites of Power? Or that they offer guided tours/hikes to recognized places of power in their area? Find out what they are here. But not only these places of power have a special effect: we also show you some special natural sites that will definitely invite you to stop and reflect. What is a place of power? “Places of power are in vogue. But their effects are not scientifically proven.” SRF in its article on magical nature A place of power is a geographical location in nature where, according to esoteric belief, a particular energy or earth radiation exists. Scientific methods cannot prove this; instead, people identify such places using a pendulum or divining rod.People also designate some power places based on ley lines or Feng Shui principles. Some (or many) also use the term for places in nature that are simply beautiful and subjectively uplifting. You can probably think of an example right now, can’t you? Places of power and tourism Powerful sites are key attractions in the tourism industry—take Stonehenge, for example! In 2019, authorities closed Ayers Rock in Uluru-Kata Tjuta National Park after the Anangu people protested. They opposed the increasing number of tourists climbing their sacred mountain, damaging the environment, and trampling on their cultural heritage. Uluru holds deep cultural and religious significance for Australia’s indigenous people. However, with our Green PearlsⓇ partners, we don’t get the impression that power places are being exploited for tourism. Instead, they often align with the personal worldview of the individual hotel hosts, particularly in the case of Feng Shui power places. Lifestyle Resort Zum Kurfürsten – An entire hotel as a Feng Shui place of power “The entire hotel has been declared a place of power by a Feng Shui master from Beijing.” – Zum Kurfürsten Lifestyle Resort Feng Shui and TCM play an important role at Lifestyle Resort Zum Kurfürsten. The wellness hotel in Bernkastel-Kues on the Mosel River used to be a simple hotel for coach tours – until Heiner Buckermann took over and transformed it into the lifestyle resort it is today. Today, it boasts a 4,500-square-foot wellness area with saunas, pools and a natural swimming pond, as well as a diet based on the Five Elements and TCM therapy. Heiner Buckermann remembers the construction phase and the Feng Shui master: “The master was visiting Germany from Beijing and met one of our TCM therapists. We were building at the time and asked for his help. The master explained the details of how to connect the energies in the place of power.” The goal was to ensure that the entire place stayed coherent and, like a turtle’s shell, blocked negative energies. To achieve this, they directed the water from the various pools to flow in a specific way, and followed precise instructions on maintaining contact with the street or hotel staircase to protect the energy of the Power Place. By connecting all the outbuildings to the main building, the energy can “flow freely”. The choice of materials, the polygonal tiles, the nine flags on the street – everything follows the Feng Shui rules for a place of power. According to Heiner Buckermann, the Feng Shui instructions were all “logical” and “pleasant” and “contributed positively to the design of the hotel. The master himself then declared the entire hotel to be a place of power, and anyone sensitive to this can still feel it today. Biohotel Grafenast – A place of power, confirmed by geomancers Peter Unterlechner of the Biohotel Grafenast in Tyrol, Austria, also believes in flowing qi and has had the hotel, now in its third generation, aligned accordingly. “We had the grounds designed according to Feng Shui and then had them tested by a geomancer,” says Peter Unterlechner. The geomancer confirmed that both the hotel and the surrounding nature are places of power. The hotel sits beautifully in the mountains, offering stunning views of the valley. “The panoramic location and the combination of an old house and a fresh spirit bring the power to life and make it tangible” – Biohotel Grafenast You can create your own places of power As you can see from the examples, you can create your own places of power by implementing certain esoteric rules. “We have created various places of power ourselves,” reports the HUBERTUS Mountain Refugio Allgäu. There are various retreats in the wellness area of the Mountain Spring Spa and the “Power of Silence” place with a bonsai tree. The sustainably managed hotel is also an advocate of Ayurveda and mindfulness, offering yoga classes and retreats throughout the year. At Naturhotel Gerbehof, the owners strongly believe in the Philippi method. They offer bioenergetic motivation sessions in-house, and there is a stone circle in their private forest where guests can experience a “meditation on the four primary elements.” Crystal Garden at Gut Guntrams If you are interested in crystals, the Gut Guntrams near Vienna has an impressive crystal garden with some huge exhibits. However, owner Stefan Gergley does not make any esoteric connections. He simply has a passion for crystals, petrified wood and minerals, he explains, and shares them in his private collection and his own nature museum at Gut Guntrams. Places of power around sustainable hotels Many Green PearlsⓇ accommodations are located near one or more places of power. The way these sites are transformed into a tourist experience varies widely. The “Snake God’s” place of worship must not be disturbed For example, Rajiv Desraj Shrestha, general manager of The Pavilions Himalayas – The Farm in Nepal, knows of a place of power near the resort – but he won’t take you there because he thinks tourists (and people in general) are a disruptive factor. “We have a place of power. It is a very old place of worship according to Hindu understanding, dedicated to the ‘Snake God’ and according to Hinduism can only be worshipped on certain auspicious days. In general, it is disturbed by human presence and therefore a visit is not recommended.” – Rajiv Desraj Shrestha Temples and the “holy forest” to experience in Thailand At Keemala in Phuket, on the other hand, the surrounding power spots are integrated into the program. They tell us there are three areas: The enchantingly beautiful Keemala Resort is nestled in the tropical forest of Phuket. Guests of the Hotel Weihrerhof in South Tyrol will receive a “power places booklet”. The Pichler family, who run the Hotel Weihrerhof* on the shores of Lake Costalovara in Renon, South Tyrol, actively sought out places of natural power in the area around their hotel. This came about because the host family carefully studied the surrounding nature. Of particular interest are the Celtic-Rhaetian sites and settlements typical of the Ritten. When exploring places of power, their goal is to “feel more and think less”. In order to understand the energy involved, they have enlisted the help of geomancer Bernd Traber. As a guest, you will find a small booklet in your room in which you can learn more about each place and get ideas for consciously experiencing them. Afterwards you can visit them with a new feeling and let nature have a deeper effect on you. Hotel room design inspired by a place of power in Bad Herrenalb The SCHWARZWALD PANORAMA has just renovated its hotel rooms (according to Cradle to Cradle™) and created the room category “Falkenstein”. The Falkenstein is a local landmark in Bad Herrenalb, and according to hotel owner Stephan Bode, the “vibrating primeval energy” is particularly noticeable here. He wanted the new hotel rooms to reflect this: “As soon as you enter the room, you feel a unique and unbridled energy – powerful and balanced. Falkenstein is the perfect design concept for every guest who wants to feel primal power.” Bad Herrenalb – a place of power There are also other places of power in the area, such as one “directly above the junction of the two supercontinents of Gondwana and Laurasia”. The entire town of Bad Herrenalb is considered a healing place of power, evident from the unusually large number of twin trees, a wonder pine growing on an archway, and its healing water and climate. The hotel team emphasizes that you don’t have to believe in the special power of Bad Herrenalb to feel it: “Even guests unfamiliar with the special qualities of the place often confirm at check-out that they feel relaxed and energized.” – SCHWARZWALD PANORAMA Recharge your batteries in Warper Wood Sisters Maren Geisler-Okelmann and Kristin Okelmann of eco-hotel Okelmann’s in Warpe are spiritually open. The water that flows through their pipes has been revitalized using the Grander method, and the hotel offers yoga, meditation, and sound massages. “Our power spot, almost on our doorstep, is the magical Warper Wood. We do some retreats that include forest bathing. We spend as much time there as possible.” – Hotel Okelmanns “Heartstone” Place of Power near Hotel Klosterhof – Alpine Hideaway & Spa The health hotel Klosterhof – Alpine Hideaway & Spa has a focus on medicine and is happy to offer scientifically based methods (e.g. medical liver fasting instead of other types of fasting). Additionally, you can participate in a guided forest bathing tour. The guide Jana likes to integrate the power place Herzstein into her tour. It is only a 5 minute walk from the hotel. Lisa-Maria Standl from the hotel says: “I’ve been there several times, and even though it’s a bit esoteric, I think the word ‘place of power’ is appropriate. Hexenbödele on the Ritten in South Tyrol Near the APIPURA hotel rinner* on the Ritten in South Tyrol, there is a mystical place called “Hexenbödele”. It is a forest clearing with a larch tree in the middle. Legend says that devils and witches once danced here. One night, a young boy, wanting to prove his courage, visited the place. By morning, they found him lifeless—trampled to death by the witches. After this tragic event, they hung a crucifix in the larch tree to honor the boy, and since then, the witches are said to avoid the place. In addition to the Hexenböderle, Karin Rinner from the hotel’s host family recommends the Waldner Eck and the Mitterstieler See viewpoint. “I often visit the places of power around us because they are breathtaking sites where you can get a lot of strength.” – Karin Rinner Stone circle in Seefeld In Seefeld, where the sustainable Hotel Klosterbräu is located, there is a stone circle as a place of power. They built it on the Pfarrerbichl as a “magical place.” In 2000, they measured the constellation, and in 2007, they inaugurated the place of power. The 12 stones are meant to represent the 12 apostles, and in the middle, there is a way of the cross, starting from the parish church in Seefeld. The Hotel Klosterbräu was built on the 500-year-old walls of an old monastery. The staff here likes to play with biblical names. The sunbathing area by the outdoor pool is called the “Garden of Eden.” And down in the vaults is the “Cellar of Sin“. Places of natural power with our Green PearlsⓇ partners As we researched the places of power among our Green PearlsⓇ partners, many emphasized the natural treasures of their surroundings. The sea as an inexhaustible source of energy in Tenerife At the OCÉANO Health Spa Hotel on the island of Tenerife, they believe that the Atlantic Ocean, which borders the hotel, is a powerful source of energy. “The sea gives peace and strength. You can feel and experience this source of strength and find your own rhythm.” – OCÉANO Health Spa Hotel The sea also plays an important role in the various health therapies offered by the hotel, such as “Ocean Balancing” or “Thalasso”. Subjective places of power in East Tyrol The Naturhotel Outside in Matrei in East Tyrol immediately named four places that, in their opinion, are suitable for subjective experience as a place of power.: The best way to experience the power of the East Tyrolean Alps is by hiking. The Outside Nature Hotel is an official hiking hotel located in the heart of the Hohe Tauern National Park. Find out more in our interview with hiking concierge Karin Steiner. Place of Power Matterhorn Switzerland’s most famous mountain, the Matterhorn, is also often described as a “place of power” – with no esoteric overtones. “The mountain is often seen as a place that gives people energy and inspiration,” reports the CERVO Mountain Resort in Zermatt. The nature-oriented design resort offers direct views of the Swiss landmark. Recharge your batteries with a forest bath in South Tyrol At the adults-only wellness hotel My Arbor*, the surrounding forest is mentioned. It not only provides “a picturesque backdrop for the hotel,” but also “a retreat full of peace and natural energy. My Arbor offers forest bathing at least once a week as part of its weekly program. “Forest bathing is a wonderful way to reduce stress, clear the mind and harmonize body and soul. The soothing effects of the trees and pure mountain air are appreciated by many of our guests.” – My Arbor The Riva Waterfalls in Sand in Taufers From the energy-self-sufficient OLM Nature Escape* in Sand in Taufers, South Tyrol, it is only a 30-minute walk to the Reinbach Waterfalls. These are three spectacular waterfalls in the Tauferer Ahrntal. The upper and middle ones are about 50 meters high and the lower one is over 10 meters high. According to OLM Nature Escape, the Reinbach Waterfalls are one of the most beautiful destinations in the area. Definitely an energizing place to recharge your batteries. The aparthotel itself is also a special place – the round building blends harmoniously into nature. Do places of power work? Many people visit a place of power and “recharge their batteries” – from nature, from pausing, from consciously pausing. There are scientists who are trying to scientifically prove the healing effects of nature (e.g. through forest bathing). There are already some indications, such as the reduction of stress hormones or a positive effect on the cardiovascular or immune system. However, we are talking about nature in general, not “places of power”. The most important thing is that both “official” and purely subjective places of power are always a personal feeling in the sense of “that does me good”, “that gives me strength.” Visitors to places of power do not need scientific proof of this. *CIN CODES Italien IT021072A1L46PNBHX (Hotel Weihrerhof) IT021072A1UOWUIDH4 (APIPURA hotel rinner) IT021011A1AE4737IT (My Arbor) IT021017B4CPKU6WK9 (OLM Nature Escape) Save this article as an inspiration for your next journey!"
The 5 most beautiful eco-luxury hotels in the Alps,"Do you know those moments when you walk into a room and think: “Wow, just magical!” Or enchanting, romantic… How do you create that special atmosphere? We asked professionals from international hotels for their tips on how to create a magical atmosphere during the winter months. #1 Tip: candles, candles, candles One hotel that truly deserves to be called “magical” is the Hotel Klosterbräu in Seefeld, Tyrol. Built on the site of a 500-year-old monastery, the sixth generation of the Seyrling family to run the hotel has preserved many of the old walls and vaults. Candlelight creates the perfect atmosphere. Hotel Klosterbräu is famous for its daily candle-lighting, with around 500 candles. However, a number of these have now been replaced by LED lights – fire safety and sustainability here go hand in hand. Piano music and a fireplace in the hotel bar, as well as the morning mist over the “Garden of Eden,” also add to the special atmosphere. The Lifestylehotel SAND on Germany’s Baltic coast also uses candles to create a magical atmosphere. “At SAND, we love real candlelight, and lots of it. It creates a very special, relaxed and warm atmosphere in all areas. Through the large glass windows you can especially enjoy the “blue hour” in November.” – Lifestylehotel SAND Side note: How environmentally friendly are candles? That depends on what kind of candles you use. Most candles on the market contain paraffin, a byproduct of petroleum refining, and many also contain palm oil. Both are environmentally questionable ingredients, as we explain in our look at sustainable candles. Soy candles are sustainable and vegan. Unfortunately, they are not very affordable. Tip: Buy eco-friendly candles and use them selectively. For an hour in the afternoon or evening and not as a permanent light source (which would also take away the “magic” effect). It is also better for the air quality. #2 Tip: Decorate with natural materials At the Naturresort Gerbehof in Friedrichshafen near Lake Constance and at the SCHWARZWALD PANORAMA in Bad Herrenalb, natural decorations create a charming atmosphere during the winter season. Twigs and pine cones are especially popular during the Christmas season. Floral decoration at Keemala in Phuket The Keemala in Phuket, Thailand is part of the “zero waste” movement and tries to avoid plastic throughout the resort. This includes decorations, of course. For weddings and other celebrations, Keemala uses only natural flower garlands and floral decorations that are completely biodegradable. Keemala owes its “enchanted” atmosphere to the unique architectural style of its villas, which blend seamlessly into the Thai rainforest – it would be difficult for you to recreate such a setting at home 🙂 Side note: How sustainable is decorating with natural materials? The more natural, the better! Once they’ve served their decorative purpose, colorful leaves, chestnuts, pine cones and fallen branches can go straight to the compost, where they will decompose into soil. It is less sustainable to paint or spray the leaves, especially with glitter. Glitter is made of plastic and essentially “microplastics in a can”. The small glitter particles spread quickly and can easily enter the water system. Tip: Avoid glitter and varnish when making decorations, and use natural twine to hold your natural decorations together-it can also be composted. And if you must use glitter, opt for organic glitter.. #3 Tip: Fireplace The two German Green PearlsⓇ hotels Birkenhof***** Spa & Genussresort in the Upper Palatinate and STURM in the Rhön Biosphere Reserve both recommend an open fire for a magical atmosphere. Of course, this is not easily done at home, and major renovations are not feasible. Especially if you live in a rented property. The only option then is to enjoy candles. But if you want to spend this winter in a cozy hideaway with a fireplace, you can find our recommendations here. Side note: How sustainable is a fireplace? According to the German Environmental Agency, you should avoid using a fireplace as a heat source because wood (trees) is a major CO2 sink. If you do occasionally use a fireplace, such as in a vacation home, make sure you use seasoned, untreated wood and do not use paper to light it. #4 Tip: Firebowl While you can not easily build a fireplace into your home, a fire bowl is affordable and provides a safe surface for a cozy fire in the backyard or on the patio. It is also a popular way for our sustainable partners to create a magical winter atmosphere for their guests. Hotel Das Rübezahl Naturhotel Outside Hotel Weihrerhof* Side note: How environmentally friendly is an open fire in a fire bowl? According to the German Federal Environmental Agency, there are many dangers to be aware of when using an open fire, and pollutants can also be released into the air – especially when burning green waste or shrubs. Tip: Use only untreated and well-seasoned wood in the fire bowl, and be aware of other things such as wind, flying sparks, and proper behavior around the fireplace (especially when children are present). #5 Tip: Garden lighting Garden lighting can also help create a magical atmosphere. For example, Gut Guntrams near Vienna illuminates its Crystal Garden (which is already magical) and its water lily pond features underwater lighting. Side note: How sustainable is garden lighting? At night, darkness is best. In particular, insects and other nocturnal animals can be disturbed by lighting. For this reason, some regions have designated light-protected areas. Tip: You don’t have to leave your lights on all night. When planning your garden lighting, make sure you can turn it off. Some solar garden plugs, for example, are not designed to be turned off. Then you can use the lighting on a limited basis (when you’re expecting guests, like a hotel) and turn it off when it’s no longer needed. Tip: Colorful foods to beat the winter blues We recently received a rather unusual tip from the LA VIMEA Vegan Hotel** in Naturns, South Tyrol: “We create a magical atmosphere during the dreary fall months with the fantastic colors of our all-vegan menu!” Colorful food and bright colors in general lift the spirits and create a special magic! We hope these tips help you look forward to the magical season of fall with positivity and anticipation, and whet your appetite for coziness!

Impressive Thailand: visiting the Black Lahu in Ban Jabo,"Regarded as one of the most beautiful hotels in Thailand, Keemala is committed not only to luxury but also to sustainability. However, few of us can afford a full holiday at the luxurious resort – so why not add an unforgettable sustainable luxury weekend to your Thailand trip? This is the eleventh in our series of ‘Tips for a sustainable weekend getaway’. Every three weeks there will be a new green idea on our blog! Welcome to Keemala – The best resort in Thailand “Truly perhaps the best hotel in Thailand.”– Johnny Ward on his Blog OneStep4Ward about the Keemala Travel budget in Thailand Most of us don’t have an unlimited travel budget. A night at Keemala costs between US$400 and US$1,500, depending on which of the extravagant pool villas you choose, what additional services you use and the time of year. But if you’re travelling on a budget and looking for cheaper accommodation and homestays (you can find out more about sustainable accommodation in our Green Travel Guide for Southeast Asia) while you explore the country, you can add Keemala as a luxury highlight to your trip. A weekend just to enjoy and be pampered. No sightseeing and no fear of missing out 😉 Because you’ve already done that. This is what your sustainable luxury weekend in Thailand could look like Keemala is not on the beach in Phuket, but tucked away in the hinterland – with 38 spectacular villas built into the tropical Thai forest. Each villa has its own pool and fantastic views of the sea or rainforest. Friday – Arrival As soon as you arrive, you will realise that you are not staying in just any hotel. You will be greeted with coconut tea and a butler waiting for you. He will take your bags to your villa and give you a short tour of the resort. You will immediately notice that there is almost no plastic, everything is made from natural materials from the region. Once you have settled into your accommodation, take some time to explore the grounds with its enchanted forest, waterfalls, organic garden and other wonders. Welcome to Keemala! In the evening you can dine at the “Mala Restaurant” and finish the day with a moonlit drink in your private pool. Saturday – A day to enjoy Start the morning with a sumptuous breakfast buffet that leaves nothing to be desired. Enjoy fresh fruit, some grown on the property, blended into a smoothie of your choice. There are also European classics such as freshly baked croissants. The dough takes four days to make and is folded 28 times by Mala’s kitchen team. Afterwards you can use the resort’s gym or swim in the large communal pool. “ The (communal) pool has such a beautiful setting. It feels like you’re deep in the Thai jungle, but with a swim-up bar and staff on hand with cold water and coffee.” – Johnny Ward Spa treatment, yoga or cooking class In the afternoon, take advantage of one of the resort’s many activities. These include The resort also specializes in ‘holistic retreats’ with yoga and meditation, though these are 3- or 6-day packages. However, if you are interested, you can book a private yoga session (60 minutes) with one of the experienced teachers. In the evening, another sumptuous dinner and your personal villa await. Sunday – Departure Before you check out, enjoy a final dip in your private pool and take time to savor your zero-waste breakfast. Avoiding disposable products is part of Keemala’s commitment to sustainability. Instead of paper napkins, they use washable cloth napkins; water is only available in refillable bottles (which are always available to guests as a service) and at the buffet, small portions are served in hygienic glass containers. Not only is this better for the environment, it is also of much higher quality. Keemala is owned by a family that has lived in Phuket for generations – not a common occurrence in Thailand. The villas also reflect different ‘tribes’ and reference Thai culture. You will find that at Keemala, many details and small touches reflect the overall concept, making it simply perfect.
