Travel,"The round trip to/from your Erasmus destination is a fundamental part of your mobility experience. The way you do it though, makes a difference. As the most extensive mobility scheme in the world, the Erasmus programme moves thousands of students who inevitably contribute significant carbon emissions. Emissions from aviation in particular have been rising rapidly over the past two decades. Technical solutions, such as transitioning to sustainable aviation fuels are still far from being mainstream, and still do not eliminate emissions entirely. Therefore, we need to consider changes in behaviour when it comes to travel choices. Before starting your Erasmus+ exchange, consider measuring the carbon footprint of different transport options and check how your journey affects the climate.

Luggage,"Packing a bag is part of every trip and no matter how old you are, you ask yourself the same question every time: what do I need to pack? For an Erasmus semester, packing a bag is twice as difficult because you have to think about what you will need for the next six months and how you will fit everything in! With little space in your bags, you have to think carefully about what you really need and what you don't.

Accommodation,"Furniture/Equipment/Accommodation When it comes to furnishing or equipping your Erasmus accommodation, the first point of contact will be the landlord or current tenants. It is important to get as much information as possible about the furnishing of the flat before departure, as this makes it easier to plan what you need to source when you get there and what can be brought from home. Once you’ve got the list of the things that you will need,  try to find out about swap or second-hand markets in advance so that it is not necessary to buy new things on-site and items can be taken from departing Erasmus students.
Before departure, it is important to know if items such as duvets, towels, hoovers or dishes are in your accommodation and if not, where you can get them from in the most sustainable way. Beyond sourcing furnishings, it is also important to consider how the items you buy are made and, if you buy from big furniture retailers, how sustainable their production is. If you buy a new product, you have to be aware that, for example, one chair can emit 27kg of carbon dioxide during its production. That amount is equivalent to driving over 100 kilometres with an average car. At the same time, over 9 million tonnes of furniture are thrown away every year, most of which are only 10 to 15 years old. A good way to find products and companies that sell sustainable products is to look at the European Ecolabel catalogue. The ECAT is a list of companies that have been awarded the EU Ecolabel for their products and services.

Furniture & Equipment,"As before mobility, it is also important during mobility to inform yourself about swap markets and second-hand shops. When you arrive, you often notice that your flat is not fully equipped or that you have forgotten something. In order to be CO2 neutral, you can often buy the missing items in cheaper second-hand shops without having to cut back on quality.
You can also find out about swap markets at your host university during your stay. If there are none, this is a good time to take the initiative and set up such platforms. Often, simple social media groups are enough to start a swap market.
If you do need to buy new items for your accommodation, it is important to pay attention to the sustainability of these products. Materials, durability and recyclability are crucial parameters to consider when buying new furniture.
Just as it is important to purchase items, it is also important to consider sustainability when disposing of them. Each country has different methods for disposing of waste, and larger items such as furniture are usually scrapped separately. Information on how to dispose of things in the most sustainable way can usually be found on the website of the city or waste management company. Due to the relatively short duration of the Erasmus, compared to the longevity of the furniture, it makes sense not to resort to new items. In addition, passing on and exchanging furniture between students creates a social aspect that goes beyond simply buying.

Travel,"Travelling during your Erasmus exchange is among the things you will love the most. Make sure you do it in a sustainable way though! Your host city has cheap flight connections? Why don't you discover the region by land? While bus and train connections might not be good between different countries, domestic land connections are usually efficient. In some countries you can get cheaper tickets depending on your status (student) and age (usually under 26). The journey, not just the destination, matters: travelling by land means you can enjoy the scenic route and discover different landscapes and towns you pass by. Much better than an endless and unvaried bed of clouds, isn't it? Not convinced? Look at the emissions from different modes of transport for a motivational boost!

Food,"When it comes to the climate emergency and biodiversity crisis we can’t ignore food. How and what we farm, fish, eat and dispose of are some of the biggest contributors to climate change and the loss of nature. Industrial animal farming (also known as a factory or intensive farming), unsustainable fishing, plants grown in intensive monocultures and overly processed food have created an unsustainable and inequitable food system that is not only having a negative impact on the climate and nature but also on animal welfare, farmworkers, local communities and our health. Food production methods, and their impact on both our climate and nature, vary from country to country and from farm to farm. There is just one consistency across the world: intensive farming and fishing practices are the main drivers of biodiversity loss on land and at sea and intensive meat production is one of the main causes of food-related carbon emissions. The global food system accounts for 21-37% of greenhouse gas emissions with meat and dairy being significant contributors. Another major contributor to climate change is food waste; this accounts for 8-10% of global greenhouse gas emissions. If food waste was a country it would be third behind the US and China in terms of climate emissions. 20% of food produced in the EU is wasted. It is commonly understood that a healthy diet is needed for a healthy body and to help prevent diet-related non-communicable diseases such as diabetes, heart disease, stroke and cancer; but a healthy diet is also needed for a healthy mind.

Energy,"According to Eurostat, household energy usage represents about a quarter of final energy consumption in Europe. Energy usage leads to carbon emissions and the amount of carbon that we use is related to how clean (renewable energy) or dirty (fossil fuels) the energy grid is (power stations). This can vary quite a lot depending on which country you are based in. Countries that depend mostly on coal and gas will have higher emissions per kWh of energy used, compared to those that predominantly rely on renewable energy such as geothermal. There are many ways through which we can have control over the energy that we use (e.g. we can use a tariff that uses green energy or decide on the areas of the house where we can reduce our usage) if we want to reduce our impact on the environment. With energy prices rising across Europe it is more important than ever to understand ways through which we can reduce our usage, not only from the sustainability perspective, but also for our pocket. When on a year/ semester abroad, you are likely to be renting, rather than living in an apartment that you own, therefore our advice is going to mostly focus on what you can do as a renter.

Waste and recycling,"The Green Erasmus Research showed that a large number of students are already engaged with the topic of sustainability. This undoubtedly includes the question of (zero-) waste and recycling. OECD statistics show that in 2020 there was the incredible amount of waste generated by each EU inhabitant - 500.4 kilograms per capita! Regardless of whether you already deal with recycling in your home country, or not, you may be confronted with it during your semester abroad and you may want to reduce your waste production. Refuse, reduce, reuse, repurpose or recycle - the big 5 - might become your mantra for your stay abroad.

University life,"Our planet is currently facing multiple environmental crises, including climate change, nature and biodiversity loss, pollution and waste, and young people are predicted to be the most affected. Universities play an important role in supporting students to think critically about our current world and develop a vision for a more sustainable future.  With 17.5 million students across the EU 27 countries, enabling them to develop the skills, understanding and values needed to turn their visions for a sustainable future into reality is a key role for our higher education institutions.  Students participating in the Green Erasmus survey concur, with 93% of respondents agreeing that in general ‘environmental sustainability is something universities should actively support and promote’. The Green Erasmus survey respondents showed a strong desire to learn about sustainability, with 85% saying it’s something they want to learn more about.  Universities can support students to develop the knowledge, skills and values needed to contribute to a sustainable future in a number of different ways, from incorporating learning opportunities within the curriculum across any academic discipline or subject area to supporting students to adopt environmentally positive habits and behaviours in their everyday lives.  Universities can also play a role in fostering connections with local communities, allowing students to actively participate in society, as future leaders in sustainability.

Travel,"Like every good story, Erasmus comes to an end eventually. Everyone needs to go back home but only few make the journey back using a sustainable mode of transport. Given the rise of carbon emissions from aviation, you might want to prove to yourself and your friends that alternative travel options are possible. We do know that this might not be the norm, as land connections in Europe significantly vary and what we call options are actually unavoidable choices.

Furniture & Equipment,"At the end of your mobility, the process you did at the beginning is reversed. Furniture that you no longer need can be sold or given away to new students via exchange platforms. If these platforms don't exist, you can also try to give the items away at other second-hand or social media markets. Of course, it is even better if you already know who will be living in the accommodation after you. This way you can inform the person about what they still need or sell or give them your items.
If there is no way to resell or pass on the items you have bought, there are always social institutions that accept furniture as donations. The donation can help institutions or families and create significant added value. The general rule for furniture and equipment is “never throw away something that could still be useful for others”.
